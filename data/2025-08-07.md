### [1] [How Deep Is Representational Bias in LLMs? The Cases of Caste and Religion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03712)
*Agrima Seth,Monojit Choudhary,Sunayana Sitaram,Kentaro Toyama,Aditya Vashistha,Kalika Bali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-4 overrepresents dominant groups in India despite prompts for diversity, suggesting that diversifying training data alone may not be sufficient to correct LLM bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal how deeply encoded representational biases are in LLMs and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of identity like religion and caste in India.

Method: Systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo by prompting it to generate over 7,200 stories about significant life events in India, using prompts designed to encourage diversity.

Result: GPT-4 overrepresents culturally dominant groups, and prompt-based nudges have limited efficacy in dislodging these biases. Representational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased than the likely distribution bias in their training data.

Conclusion: GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups far beyond their statistical representation, and repeated prompt-based nudges have limited efficacy in dislodging these biases. Diversifying training data alone may not be sufficient to correct LLM bias.

Abstract: Representational bias in large language models (LLMs) has predominantly been
measured through single-response interactions and has focused on Global
North-centric identities like race and gender. We expand on that research by
conducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded
representational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of
identity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about
significant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to
encourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious
and caste representation in the outputs against the actual population
distribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and
"stickiness" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We
find that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups
far beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to
encourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that
representational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased
than the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated
prompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these
biases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be
sufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental
changes in model development. Dataset and Codebook:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop specialized language models for High-Energy Theoretical Physics.

Method: Fine-tuned variants of the 8-billion parameter Llama-3.1 model, trained on arXiv abstracts from different combinations of hep-th, hep-ph and gr-qc using two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning approaches and varying dataset sizes.

Result: Outperformed the base model on hep-th abstract completion tasks and were compared against leading commercial LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek).

Conclusion: Specialized Large Language Models for theoretical High-Energy Physics outperform base models on hep-th abstract completion tasks.

Abstract: We present specialized Large Language Models for theoretical High-Energy
Physics, obtained as 20 fine-tuned variants of the 8-billion parameter
Llama-3.1 model. Each variant was trained on arXiv abstracts (through August
2024) from different combinations of hep-th, hep-ph and gr-qc. For a

from disparate fields such as the q-bio and cs categories. All models were
fine-tuned using two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning approaches and
varying dataset sizes, and outperformed the base model on hep-th abstract
completion tasks. We compare performance against leading commercial LLMs
(ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) and derive insights for further developing
specialized language models for High-Energy Theoretical Physics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一种AI农业聊天机器人，旨在用易于理解的语言为印度农民提供农业建议，并通过意图驱动的对话和检索增强生成技术实现了高准确率和快速响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度农民通常缺乏及时、可访问且语言友好的农业建议，尤其是在文化程度较低的农村地区。

Method: 该论文提出了一个新颖的AI驱动的农业聊天机器人Krishi Sathi，旨在通过文本和语音为印度农民提供个性化的、易于理解的答案。该系统首先通过 IFT 模型构建，随后通过在三个精心策划的印度农业知识数据集上进行微调来完善。

Result: 该系统实现了 97.53% 的查询响应准确率、91.35% 的上下文相关性和个性化，以及 97.53% 的查询完成率。平均响应时间保持在 6 秒以下。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，结合意图驱动的对话流程、指令调整模型和基于检索的生成可以提高印度数字农业支持的质量和可访问性。

Abstract: Indian farmers often lack timely, accessible, and language-friendly
agricultural advice, especially in rural areas with low literacy. To address
this gap in accessibility, this paper presents a novel AI-powered agricultural
chatbot, Krishi Sathi, designed to support Indian farmers by providing
personalized, easy-to-understand answers to their queries through both text and
speech. The system's intelligence stems from an IFT model, subsequently refined
through fine-tuning on Indian agricultural knowledge across three curated
datasets. Unlike traditional chatbots that respond to one-off questions, Krishi
Sathi follows a structured, multi-turn conversation flow to gradually collect
the necessary details from the farmer, ensuring the query is fully understood
before generating a response. Once the intent and context are extracted, the
system performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by first fetching
information from a curated agricultural database and then generating a tailored
response using the IFT model. The chatbot supports both English and Hindi
languages, with speech input and output features (via ASR and TTS) to make it
accessible for users with low literacy or limited digital skills. This work
demonstrates how combining intent-driven dialogue flows, instruction-tuned
models, and retrieval-based generation can improve the quality and
accessibility of digital agricultural support in India.
  This approach yielded strong results, with the system achieving a query
response accuracy of 97.53%, 91.35% contextual relevance and personalization,
and a query completion rate of 97.53%. The average response time remained under
6 seconds, ensuring timely support for users across both English and Hindi
interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikipedia faces significant challenges in maintaining up-to-date content due to its reliance on manual human editors. Inspired by the vision of continuous knowledge acquisition in NELL and fueled by advances in LLM-based agents

Method: a multi-agent framework to aggregate online information, select new and important knowledge, and then generate precise edit suggestions for human review. Fine-grained editing models, trained on Wikipedia's extensive history of human edits, enable incorporating updates in a manner consistent with human editing behavior.

Result: editor models outperform both open-source instruction-following baselines and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) in key information coverage and editing efficiency.

Conclusion: WINELL demonstrates the ability to identify and suggest timely factual updates, opening up a promising research direction in LLM agents for automatically updating knowledge bases in a never-ending fashion.

Abstract: Wikipedia, a vast and continuously consulted knowledge base, faces
significant challenges in maintaining up-to-date content due to its reliance on
manual human editors. Inspired by the vision of continuous knowledge
acquisition in NELL and fueled by advances in LLM-based agents, this paper
introduces WiNELL, an agentic framework for continuously updating Wikipedia
articles. Our approach employs a multi-agent framework to aggregate online
information, select new and important knowledge for a target entity in
Wikipedia, and then generate precise edit suggestions for human review. Our
fine-grained editing models, trained on Wikipedia's extensive history of human
edits, enable incorporating updates in a manner consistent with human editing
behavior. Our editor models outperform both open-source instruction-following
baselines and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) in key information coverage and
editing efficiency. End-to-end evaluation on high-activity Wikipedia pages
demonstrates WiNELL's ability to identify and suggest timely factual updates.
This opens up a promising research direction in LLM agents for automatically
updating knowledge bases in a never-ending fashion.

### [6] [GanitBench: A bi-lingual benchmark for evaluating mathematical reasoning in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03737)
*Ashutosh Bandooni,Brindha Subburaj*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces GanitBench, a bilingual (English and Hindi) vision-only question benchmark for evaluating VLMs on mathematical reasoning. GPT-4o mini achieves the highest accuracy, but performance drops with a 'Double Lock' constraint and in Hindi.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarks for evaluating reasoning among Vision Language Models (VLMs) on several fields and domains are being curated more frequently over the last few years. However these are often monolingual, mostly available in English. Additionally there also is a lack of datasets available in Hindi on tasks apart from comprehension and translation.

Method: The authors evaluate two closed source models for the same, in zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and two-shot CoT settings. They also evaluate models through a 'Double Lock' constraint.

Result: GPT-4o mini is found to be the more dominant model on the benchmark, with it's highest average accuracy being 38.15%. Performance of the models decreases considerably under a Double Lock constraint. Two-shot CoT appears to be a more effective setting under this environment.

Conclusion: The performance of two VLMs decreases when answering the same questions in the Hindi language. The authors hope to facilitate the inclusion of languages like Hindi in research through their work.

Abstract: Benchmarks for evaluating reasoning among Vision Language Models (VLMs) on
several fields and domains are being curated more frequently over the last few
years. However these are often monolingual, mostly available in English.
Additionally there also is a lack of datasets available in Hindi on tasks apart
from comprehension and translation. We introduce GanitBench, a tough benchmark
consisting of 1527 vision-only questions covering several topics in Mathematics
- available in languages English and Hindi. Collected from two major
examinations from India, the JEE Advanced and the CBSE Boards examinations,
this benchmark includes questions in the form of images comprising of figures
essential to a question as well as text. We evaluate two closed source models
for the same, in zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and two-shot CoT settings.
GPT-4o mini is found to be the more dominant model on the benchmark, with it's
highest average accuracy being 38.15%. We also evaluate models through a
"Double Lock" constraint, which brings down the performance of the models by
considerable margins. We observe that two-shot CoT appears to be a more
effective setting under this environment. Performance of the two VLMs also
decreases when answering the same questions in the Hindi language. We hope to
facilitate the inclusion of languages like Hindi in research through our work.

### [7] [AttnTrace: Attention-based Context Traceback for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03793)
*Yanting Wang,Runpeng Geng,Ying Chen,Jinyuan Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AttnTrace is a new, more accurate and efficient method for context traceback in long-context LLMs, using attention weights to pinpoint relevant text and detect prompt injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solutions for tracing back to a subset of texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the LLM, such as TracLLM, often lead to a high computation cost.

Method: A new context traceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a prompt, with two techniques designed to enhance its effectiveness.

Result: AttnTrace is more accurate and efficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods. It can improve state-of-the-art methods in detecting prompt injection and pinpoint injected instructions in a paper designed to manipulate LLM-generated reviews.

Conclusion: AttnTrace is more accurate and efficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods. It can improve state-of-the-art methods in detecting prompt injection under long contexts and effectively pinpoint injected instructions in a paper designed to manipulate LLM-generated reviews.

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs), such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Claude-Sonnet-4, are increasingly used to empower advanced AI systems,
including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and autonomous agents.
In these systems, an LLM receives an instruction along with a context--often
consisting of texts retrieved from a knowledge database or memory--and
generates a response that is contextually grounded by following the
instruction. Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset
of texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the
LLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including
performing post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and
trustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made,
state-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation
cost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a
single response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context
traceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a
prompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques
designed to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical
insights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for
AttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and
efficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods. We also
show that AttnTrace can improve state-of-the-art methods in detecting prompt
injection under long contexts through the attribution-before-detection
paradigm. As a real-world application, we demonstrate that AttnTrace can
effectively pinpoint injected instructions in a paper designed to manipulate
LLM-generated reviews. The code is at

### [8] [Majority Bit-Aware Watermarking For Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03829)
*Jiahao Xu,Rui Hu,Zikai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MajorMark and MajorMark$^+$, novel watermarking methods for LLMs that improve the trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy by using majority bit-aware encoding and clustering-based decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The potential misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating harmful or deceptive content necessitates watermarking techniques for origin verification and misuse tracing. Existing multi-bit watermarking schemes suffer from a trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy.

Method: The paper introduces MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that improves the trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy through majority bit-aware encoding and a clustering-based decoding strategy. It also introduces MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the message into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically decode each block.

Result: MajorMark enables a larger and more flexible sampling of tokens, and MajorMark$^+$ further enhances the quality of watermarked text and improves decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Conclusion: The proposed MajorMark and MajorMark$^+$ methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and text generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines.

Abstract: The growing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world
applications has raised concerns about their potential misuse in generating
harmful or deceptive content. To address this issue, watermarking techniques
have emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages
into generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent
efforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich
information such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the
fundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure
reliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token
sets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated
content. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that
improves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects
preferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a
larger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that
rely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a
clustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even
when the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and
decoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the
message into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically
decode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text
and improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and
text generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在庞大而多样的互联网语料库上进行训练，这些语料库通常包含不准确或具有误导性的内容。因此，LLM可能会产生错误信息，因此强大的事实核查至关重要。

Method: 该综述系统地分析了如何评估LLM生成的内容的事实准确性，探讨了幻觉、数据集限制和评估指标的可靠性等关键挑战。它提出了五个研究问题，指导对2020年至2025年最新文献的分析，重点关注评估方法和缓解技术。

Conclusion: 该综述强调了构建不仅准确和可解释，而且为特定领域的事实核查量身定制的LLM的重要性。这些见解有助于推动研究朝着更值得信赖和具有上下文意识的语言模型发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora
that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can
generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review
systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual
accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset
limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes
the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting
strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of
the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and
mitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction
tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG
frameworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the
value of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance
of domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the
review underlines the importance of building LLMs that are not only accurate
and explainable but also tailored for domain-specific fact-checking. These
insights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy and
context-aware language models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于 QA 的实体链接代理，该代理基于大型语言模型，通过模拟人类认知工作流程来主动识别实体提及、检索候选实体并做出决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一些问答 (QA) 系统依赖知识库 (KB) 来提供准确的答案。实体链接 (EL) 在将自然语言提及链接到 KB 条目方面起着关键作用。但是，大多数现有的 EL 方法都是为长上下文设计的，并且在 QA 任务中的简短、模棱两可的用户问题上表现不佳。

Method: 我们提出了一个基于大型语言模型的 QA 实体链接代理，该模型模拟了人类认知工作流程。

Result: 为了验证我们主体的有效性，我们进行了两个实验：基于工具的实体链接和 QA 任务评估。

Conclusion: 该研究的结果证实了该主体的稳健性和有效性。

Abstract: Some Question Answering (QA) systems rely on knowledge bases (KBs) to provide
accurate answers. Entity Linking (EL) plays a critical role in linking natural
language mentions to KB entries. However, most existing EL methods are designed
for long contexts and do not perform well on short, ambiguous user questions in
QA tasks. We propose an entity linking agent for QA, based on a Large Language
Model that simulates human cognitive workflows. The agent actively identifies
entity mentions, retrieves candidate entities, and makes decision. To verify
the effectiveness of our agent, we conduct two experiments: tool-based entity
linking and QA task evaluation. The results confirm the robustness and
effectiveness of our agent.

TL;DR: Sotopia-RL通过语句级信用分配和多维奖励设计，提升了大型语言模型在社交环境中的强化学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型 (LLM) 的社交智能已成为一项关键能力，使其能够有效地参与到现实世界的社交任务中，例如适应、说服、协作和谈判。强化学习 (RL) 非常适合训练具有社交智能的智能体，因为它允许模型直接通过社交互动来学习复杂的策略。然而，社交互动有两个关键特征为 RL 训练设置了障碍：(1) 局部可观察性，其中话语具有间接和延迟的影响，这使得信用分配变得复杂，以及 (2) 多维度性，其中诸如建立融洽关系或寻求知识等行为间接促进了目标的实现。这些特征使得基于马尔可夫决策过程 (MDP) 的 RL 与单维度 эпизод 级别奖励的效率低下且不稳定。

Method: 提出了Sotopia-RL框架，该框架将粗略的 эпизод 级别反馈改进为语句级别、多维奖励。

Result: Sotopia-RL 实现了最先进的社交目标完成分数（在 Sotopia-hard 上为 7.17，在 Sotopia-full 上为 8.31），显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Sotopia-RL在开放式社交学习环境Sotopia中表现出色，在社交目标完成得分方面显著优于现有方法。消融研究证实了语句级信用分配和多维奖励设计的必要性。

Abstract: Social intelligence has become a critical capability for large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to engage effectively in real-world social tasks
such as accommodation, persuasion, collaboration, and negotiation.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent
agents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly
through social interactions. However, social interactions have two key
characteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability,
where utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit
assignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as
rapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal
achievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL
with single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To
address these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines
coarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards.
Utterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by
attributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards
capture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking.
Experiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate
that Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17
on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level
credit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training. Our
implementation is publicly available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoAct-1, a multi-agent system combining GUI control with coding, achieving state-of-the-art results on the OSWorld benchmark with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents that operate computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) often struggle with efficiency and reliability on complex, long-horizon tasks. While augmenting these agents with planners can improve task decomposition, they remain constrained by the inherent limitations of performing all actions through GUI manipulation, leading to brittleness and inefficiency.

Method: introducing CoAct-1, a novel multi-agent system that synergistically combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic execution.

Result: CoAct-1 achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves efficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to just 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents.

Conclusion: Integrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and scalable path toward generalized computer automation.

Abstract: Autonomous agents that operate computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
often struggle with efficiency and reliability on complex, long-horizon tasks.
While augmenting these agents with planners can improve task decomposition,
they remain constrained by the inherent limitations of performing all actions
through GUI manipulation, leading to brittleness and inefficiency. In this
work, we introduce a more robust and flexible paradigm: enabling agents to use
coding as a enhanced action. We present CoAct-1, a novel multi-agent system
that synergistically combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic
execution. CoAct-1 features an Orchestrator that dynamically delegates subtasks
to either a conventional GUI Operator or a specialized Programmer agent, which
can write and execute Python or Bash scripts. This hybrid approach allows the
agent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management
and data processing, while still leveraging visual interaction when necessary.
We evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, where CoAct-1
achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly
outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves
efficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to
just 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Our results demonstrate that
integrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and
scalable path toward generalized computer automation.

capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text generation, we propose
Context-Augmented Personalized LLM (CAP-LLM), a novel framework that integrates
user preferences and factual consistency constraints into a powerful
pre-trained LLM backbone. CAP-LLM features a User Preference Encoder to capture
long-term user interests, a Context Injection Adapter to seamlessly integrate
these preferences and current article context into the LLM's generation
process, and a Fact-Consistency Reinforcement Module employing a novel
contrastive loss to mitigate hallucination. Evaluated on the real-world PENS
dataset, CAP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics.
Notably, it significantly improves factual consistency (FactCC of 87.50) over
strong baselines like BART (86.67), while simultaneously enhancing
personalization (Pc(avg) 2.73, Pc(max) 17.25) and content coverage (ROUGE-1
26.55, ROUGE-2 9.95, ROUGE-L 23.01). Our ablation studies, human evaluations,
and sensitivity analyses further validate the effectiveness of each component
and the robustness of our approach, demonstrating CAP-LLM's ability to achieve
a superior balance between personalization and factual accuracy in news
headline generation.

Abstract: In this paper, we cover approaches to systematically govern, assess and
quantify bias across the complete life cycle of machine learning models, from
initial development and validation to ongoing production monitoring and
guardrail implementation. Building upon our foundational work on the Bias
Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite (BEATS) for Large Language Models, the
authors share prevalent bias and fairness related gaps in Large Language Models
(LLMs) and discuss data and AI governance framework to address Bias, Ethics,
Fairness, and Factuality within LLMs. The data and AI governance approach
discussed in this paper is suitable for practical, real-world applications,
enabling rigorous benchmarking of LLMs prior to production deployment,
facilitating continuous real-time evaluation, and proactively governing LLM
generated responses. By implementing the data and AI governance across the life
cycle of AI development, organizations can significantly enhance the safety and
responsibility of their GenAI systems, effectively mitigating risks of
discrimination and protecting against potential reputational or brand-related
harm. Ultimately, through this article, we aim to contribute to advancement of
the creation and deployment of socially responsible and ethically aligned
generative artificial intelligence powered applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: the high token expenditure of self-consistency can limit its practical utility.

Method: This paper design a fast weighted set cover algorithm that utilizes the two indicators: (a) the model's own confidence in individual hypotheses, and (b) lexical coverage of all current hypotheses by candidate subsets that are under consideration for continued retention.

Result: improve token efficiency for all models, by 10-35% in many cases.

Conclusion: This method can improve token efficiency for all models, by 10-35% in many cases.

Abstract: Despite its simplicity and efficacy, the high token expenditure of
self-consistency can limit its practical utility. Here we investigate if
self-consistency can be made more token-efficient for long chain-of-thought
reasoning tasks, while preserving its parallelism, through early hypothesis
pruning. Concretely, we generate all solutions in parallel, but periodically
prune intermediate hypotheses that are deemed unnecessary based on two
lightweight indicators: (a) the model's own confidence in individual
hypotheses, and (b) lexical coverage of all current hypotheses by candidate
subsets that are under consideration for continued retention. We design a fast
weighted set cover algorithm that utilizes the two indicators; our evaluation
of five LLMs on three math benchmarks shows that this method can improve token
efficiency for all models, by 10-35% in many cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Individuals increasingly consult Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand well-being, a key challenge emerges: Can LLMs generate explanations that are not only accurate but also tailored to diverse audiences?

Method: constructing a large-scale dataset and employing dual judges to assess explanation quality

Result: explanation quality varies significantly across models, audiences, and categories

Conclusion: DPO- and SFT-finetuned models outperform their larger counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of preference-based learning for specialized explanation tasks.

Abstract: Well-being encompasses mental, physical, and social dimensions essential to
personal growth and informed life decisions. As individuals increasingly
consult Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand well-being, a key challenge
emerges: Can LLMs generate explanations that are not only accurate but also
tailored to diverse audiences? High-quality explanations require both factual
correctness and the ability to meet the expectations of users with varying
expertise. In this work, we construct a large-scale dataset comprising 43,880
explanations of 2,194 well-being concepts, generated by ten diverse LLMs. We
introduce a principle-guided LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework, employing
dual judges to assess explanation quality. Furthermore, we show that
fine-tuning an open-source LLM using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) can significantly enhance the quality of
generated explanations. Our results reveal: (1) The proposed LLM judges align
well with human evaluations; (2) explanation quality varies significantly
across models, audiences, and categories; and (3) DPO- and SFT-finetuned models
outperform their larger counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of
preference-based learning for specialized explanation tasks.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种社交机器人协同促进器，它使用可解释的概念瓶颈模型，通过模仿专家促进者的推理来增强群体会议的效果，优于直接使用大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成功的群体会议必须促进个人目标设定和执行，同时加强群体内的社会关系。促进者面临挑战和认知负荷，因此需要一种能够解读社会交流的具身技术，同时了解群体中个人的需求，并提供透明的建议。

Method: 使用代理概念瓶颈模型 (CBM) 的社交机器人协同促进器，该模型基于参与者参与度和情绪等人类可解释的概念做出决策，确保透明度和可信度。

Result: 该系统在预测干预需求方面明显优于直接的 zero-shot FMs，并能够实时人工校正其推理。该模型可以跨不同群体进行概括，并成功地转移高级人类促进者的专业知识以提高新手的能力。

Conclusion: 该研究通过将专家认知模型转移到可解释的机器人伙伴中，为增强复杂社交领域的人类能力提供了一个强大的蓝图。

Abstract: Successful group meetings, such as those implemented in group
behavioral-change programs, work meetings, and other social contexts, must
promote individual goal setting and execution while strengthening the social
relationships within the group. Consequently, an ideal facilitator must be
sensitive to the subtle dynamics of disengagement, difficulties with individual
goal setting and execution, and interpersonal difficulties that signal a need
for intervention. The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators
create a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social
exchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group
and providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but "black
box" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues. We address this
important demand with a social robot co-facilitator that analyzes multimodal
meeting data and provides discreet cues to the facilitator. The robot's
reasoning is powered by an agentic concept bottleneck model (CBM), which makes
decisions based on human-interpretable concepts like participant engagement and
sentiments, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. Our core contribution is
a transfer learning framework that distills the broad social understanding of
an FM into our specialized and transparent CBM. This concept-driven system
significantly outperforms direct zero-shot FMs in predicting the need for
intervention and enables real-time human correction of its reasoning.
Critically, we demonstrate robust knowledge transfer: the model generalizes
across different groups and successfully transfers the expertise of senior
human facilitators to improve the performance of novices. By transferring an
expert's cognitive model into an interpretable robotic partner, our work
provides a powerful blueprint for augmenting human capabilities in complex
social domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: current research remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios, lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and utility in web environments

Method: a multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and objective optimization

Result: HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance across all tasks.

Conclusion: HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance and task completion over existing baselines.

Abstract: Large language models enable agents to autonomously perform tasks in open web
environments. However, as hidden threats within the web evolve, web agents face
the challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during
long-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research
remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios,
lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and
utility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a
multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and
objective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard
features a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental
capabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent
within HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured
security policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously
updating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective
Optimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility
Agent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning
to evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their
optimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that
HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up
to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance
across all tasks. Our project is available here:

Motivation: MLBME exhibits suboptimal performance in low-data scenarios, and its training efficiency is bottlenecked by the computation of KL divergence.

Method: a novel MLBME method that adopts Multiple Backpropagation Steps (MBPS) to improve editing performance under limited supervision and a norm regularization on weight updates to improve training efficiency

Result: SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME baselines and the MBPS strategy can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods to further boost their performance.

Conclusion: SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME baselines, and the MBPS strategy can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods to further boost their performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) underpin many AI applications, but their static
nature makes updating knowledge costly. Model editing offers an efficient
alternative by injecting new information through targeted parameter
modifications. In particular, meta-learning-based model editing (MLBME) methods
have demonstrated notable advantages in both editing effectiveness and
efficiency. Despite this, we find that MLBME exhibits suboptimal performance in
low-data scenarios, and its training efficiency is bottlenecked by the
computation of KL divergence. To address these, we propose $\textbf{S}$tep
$\textbf{M}$ore $\textbf{Edit}$ ($\textbf{SMEdit}$), a novel MLBME method that
adopts $\textbf{M}$ultiple $\textbf{B}$ackpro$\textbf{P}$agation
$\textbf{S}$teps ($\textbf{MBPS}$) to improve editing performance under limited
supervision and a norm regularization on weight updates to improve training
efficiency. Experimental results on two datasets and two LLMs demonstrate that
SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME baselines and the MBPS strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing methods to further boost their performance.
Our code will be released soon.

TL;DR: ZARA is an agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly from raw motion time-series, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HAR methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining. Recent LLM attempts suffer from limited accuracy and lack interpretability.

Method: ZARA integrates a feature knowledge base, a multi-sensor retrieval module, and a hierarchical agent pipeline to guide the LLM.

Result: ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR without fine-tuning, achieving SOTA zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance on 8 HAR benchmarks, exceeding baselines by 2.53x in macro F1. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of each module.

Abstract: Motion sensor time-series are central to human activity recognition (HAR),
with applications in health, sports, and smart devices. However, existing
methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when
new behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language
models (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images,
suffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose
ZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly
from raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise
feature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every
activity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence,
and a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select
features, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and
natural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR
without any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on
8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering
clear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.
Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as
a promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.

Motivation: 传统的 AI 模型越狱需要复杂的技术程序或专业的人工知识。本研究旨在证明大型推理模型 (LRM) 的说服能力简化并扩大了越狱的规模，使其成为非专业人士也能负担得起的活动。

Method: 使用四个大型推理模型（DeepSeek-R1、Gemini 2.5 Flash、Grok 3 Mini、Qwen3 235B）作为自主对抗者，与九个广泛使用的目标模型进行多轮对话，以此评估这些模型的越狱能力。通过系统提示向 LRM 发出指令，然后在没有进一步监督的情况下进行规划和执行越狱。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型 (LRM) 可能会侵蚀其他模型的安全护栏，因此需要进一步调整前沿模型，使其不仅能抵抗越狱攻击，还能防止它们被利用为越狱代理。

Abstract: Jailbreaking -- bypassing built-in safety mechanisms in AI models -- has
traditionally required complex technical procedures or specialized human
expertise. In this study, we show that the persuasive capabilities of large
reasoning models (LRMs) simplify and scale jailbreaking, converting it into an
inexpensive activity accessible to non-experts. We evaluated the capabilities
of four LRMs (DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, Qwen3 235B) to act as
autonomous adversaries conducting multi-turn conversations with nine widely
used target models. LRMs received instructions via a system prompt, before
proceeding to planning and executing jailbreaks with no further supervision. We
performed extensive experiments with a benchmark of harmful prompts composed of
70 items covering seven sensitive domains. This setup yielded an overall attack
success rate across all model combinations of 97.14%. Our study reveals an
alignment regression, in which LRMs can systematically erode the safety
guardrails of other models, highlighting the urgent need to further align
frontier models not only to resist jailbreak attempts, but also to prevent them
from being co-opted into acting as jailbreak agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为动态令牌级前缀增强(DTPA)的轻量级有效框架，用于可控文本生成，解决了长文本生成中可控性下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往的研究通常侧重于短序列可控文本生成的质量，而长格式文本的生成在很大程度上仍未得到探索。我们观察到，由强大的基于前缀的方法Air-Decoding生成的文本的可控性往往会随着序列长度的增加而下降，我们假设这主要是由于观察到的对前缀的注意力的衰减引起的。

Method: 提出了一种基于Air-Decoding的轻量级有效框架，名为动态令牌级前缀增强(DTPA)，用于可控文本生成。

Result: 在多个CTG任务上的实验表明，DTPA通常优于其他属性控制方法，同时保持了有竞争力的流畅性、多样性和主题相关性。

Conclusion: DTPA在属性控制方面通常优于其他方法，同时保持了有竞争力的流畅性、多样性和主题相关性。进一步的分析突出了DTPA在长文本生成方面的卓越有效性。

Abstract: Controllable Text Generation (CTG) is a vital subfield in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), aiming to generate text that aligns with desired attributes.
However, previous studies commonly focus on the quality of controllable text
generation for short sequences, while the generation of long-form text remains
largely underexplored. In this paper, we observe that the controllability of
texts generated by the powerful prefix-based method Air-Decoding tends to
decline with increasing sequence length, which we hypothesize primarily arises
from the observed decay in attention to the prefixes. Meanwhile, different
types of prefixes including soft and hard prefixes are also key factors
influencing performance. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight
and effective framework called Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation (DTPA)
based on Air-Decoding for controllable text generation. Specifically, it first
selects the optimal prefix type for a given task. Then we dynamically amplify
the attention to the prefix for the attribute distribution to enhance
controllability, with a scaling factor growing exponentially as the sequence
length increases. Moreover, based on the task, we optionally apply a similar
augmentation to the original prompt for the raw distribution to balance text
quality. After attribute distribution reconstruction, the generated text
satisfies the attribute constraints well. Experiments on multiple CTG tasks
demonstrate that DTPA generally outperforms other methods in attribute control
while maintaining competitive fluency, diversity, and topic relevance. Further
analysis highlights DTPA's superior effectiveness in long text generation.

*Wang Chen,Guanqiang Qi,Weikang Li,Yang Li,Deguo Xia,Jizhou Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAIRS is a training-free framework that integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether to retrieve and how to select external information, it reduces retrieval costs and improves accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be resolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information signals.

Method: a training-free framework that integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to both sources.

Result: PAIRS reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries) while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior baselines on average.

Conclusion: PAIRS reduces retrieval costs by around 25% while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior baselines on average.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However,
current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently
retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be
resolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk
retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information
signals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive
Information Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that
integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether
to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs
a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer
and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these
outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically
improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a
dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and
self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information
Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to
both sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance
efficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy
through contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.
Experimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS
reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)
while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior
baselines on average.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI methods benefit from annotating sentences by rhetorical roles for literature analysis and review generation.

Method: Introducing a novel annotation schema and evaluating various LLMs in classifying rhetorical roles. A new benchmark, Sci-Sentence, is presented, comprising manually and automatically labeled sentences.

Result: LLMs achieve high performance (above 96% F1) when fine-tuned. GPT-4o performs best, but some open-source models are also excellent. Semi-synthetic data improves training.

Conclusion: Current LLMs perform well in classifying rhetorical roles, especially when fine-tuned. Some open-source models show excellent performance, and semi-synthetic data improves results.

Abstract: Previous work has demonstrated that AI methods for analysing scientific
literature benefit significantly from annotating sentences in papers according
to their rhetorical roles, such as research gaps, results, limitations,
extensions of existing methodologies, and others. Such representations also
have the potential to support the development of a new generation of systems
capable of producing high-quality literature reviews. However, achieving this
goal requires the definition of a relevant annotation schema and effective
strategies for large-scale annotation of the literature. This paper addresses
these challenges by 1) introducing a novel annotation schema specifically
designed to support literature review generation and 2) conducting a
comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art large language
models (LLMs) in classifying rhetorical roles according to this schema. To this
end, we also present Sci-Sentence, a novel multidisciplinary benchmark
comprising 700 sentences manually annotated by domain experts and 2,240
sentences automatically labelled using LLMs. We evaluate 37 LLMs on this
benchmark, spanning diverse model families and sizes, using both zero-shot
learning and fine-tuning approaches. The experiments yield several novel
insights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain. First,
the current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when
fine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\% F1.
Second, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results,
some lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent
performance. Finally, enriching the training data with semi-synthetic examples
generated by LLMs proves beneficial, enabling small encoders to achieve robust
results and significantly enhancing the performance of several open decoder
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work synthesizes tool-use LLM datasets with annotation failures and low efficiency. 

Method: ToolGrad constructs valid tool-use chains through an iterative process guided by textual gradients, and then synthesizes corresponding user queries.

Result: ToolGrad-5k, a dataset generated with more complex tool use, lower cost, and 100% pass rate.

Conclusion: Models trained on ToolGrad-5k outperform those on expensive baseline datasets and proprietary LLMs, even on OOD benchmarks.

Abstract: Prior work synthesizes tool-use LLM datasets by first generating a user
query, followed by complex tool-use annotations like DFS. This leads to
inevitable annotation failures and low efficiency in data generation. We
introduce ToolGrad, an agentic framework that inverts this paradigm. ToolGrad
first constructs valid tool-use chains through an iterative process guided by
textual "gradients", and then synthesizes corresponding user queries. This
"answer-first" approach led to ToolGrad-5k, a dataset generated with more
complex tool use, lower cost, and 100% pass rate. Experiments show that models
trained on ToolGrad-5k outperform those on expensive baseline datasets and

Result: Fine-tuned transformers, especially RoBERTa (F1: 0.90, Accuracy: 95%), outperformed other models. Zero-shot LLaMA3:70B achieved an F1 of 0.86 but with high inference time. Mid-sized LLMs showed potential for optimized deployments. Logistic regression lagged behind (F1: 0.66).

Conclusion: Fine-tuned transformer models, particularly RoBERTa, offer the best balance of accuracy and efficiency for identifying secondary crashes in Kentucky crash narratives. The study highlights trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and data needs, suggesting strategies for practical deployment, including local processing and ensemble methods.

Abstract: This study evaluates advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
enhance crash data quality by mining crash narratives, using secondary crash
identification in Kentucky as a case study. Drawing from 16,656 manually
reviewed narratives from 2015-2022, with 3,803 confirmed secondary crashes, we
compare three model classes: zero-shot open-source large language models (LLMs)
(LLaMA3:70B, DeepSeek-R1:70B, Qwen3:32B, Gemma3:27B); fine-tuned transformers
(BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, Longformer); and traditional logistic
regression as baseline. Models were calibrated on 2015-2021 data and tested on
1,771 narratives from 2022. Fine-tuned transformers achieved superior
performance, with RoBERTa yielding the highest F1-score (0.90) and accuracy
(95%). Zero-shot LLaMA3:70B reached a comparable F1 of 0.86 but required 139
minutes of inference; the logistic baseline lagged well behind (F1:0.66). LLMs
excelled in recall for some variants (e.g., GEMMA3:27B at 0.94) but incurred
high computational costs (up to 723 minutes for DeepSeek-R1:70B), while
fine-tuned models processed the test set in seconds after brief training.
Further analysis indicated that mid-sized LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1:32B) can
rival larger counterparts in performance while reducing runtime, suggesting
opportunities for optimized deployments. Results highlight trade-offs between
accuracy, efficiency, and data requirements, with fine-tuned transformer models
balancing precision and recall effectively on Kentucky data. Practical
deployment considerations emphasize privacy-preserving local deployment,
ensemble approaches for improved accuracy, and incremental processing for
scalability, providing a replicable scheme for enhancing crash-data quality
with advanced NLP.

*Jianghangfan Zhang,Yibo Yan,Kening Zheng,Xin Zou,Song Dai,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces GM-PRM, a generative multimodal process reward model that actively corrects errors in multi-step mathematical reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results with high data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with complex, multi-step mathematical reasoning, and existing multimodal PRMs are limited to being binary verifiers that can identify but not correct errors, offering little explanatory power.

Method: introduce the Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model (GM-PRM)

Result: GM-PRM provides a fine-grained, interpretable analysis of each reasoning step, evaluating its step intent, visual alignment, and logical soundness; GM-PRM is trained to generate a corrected version of the first erroneous step it identifies. This enables a new test-time inference strategy, Refined Best-of-N (Refined-BoN).

Conclusion: GM-PRM achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal math benchmarks, significantly boosting policy model performance with remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a 20K-sample training dataset.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
but often struggle with complex, multi-step mathematical reasoning, where minor
errors in visual perception or logical deduction can lead to complete failure.
While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer step-by-step supervision, existing
multimodal PRMs are limited to being binary verifiers that can identify but not
correct errors, offering little explanatory power. To address these
deficiencies, we introduce the Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model
(GM-PRM), a novel paradigm that transforms the PRM from a passive judge into an
active reasoning collaborator. Instead of a simple scalar score, GM-PRM
provides a fine-grained, interpretable analysis of each reasoning step,
evaluating its step intent, visual alignment, and logical soundness. More
critically, GM-PRM is trained to generate a corrected version of the first
erroneous step it identifies. This unique corrective capability enables our new
test-time inference strategy, Refined Best-of-N (Refined-BoN). This framework
actively enhances solution quality by using the PRM's generated correction to
guide the policy model toward a more promising reasoning trajectory, thereby
improving the diversity and correctness of the solution pool. We demonstrate
that GM-PRM achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal math
benchmarks, significantly boosting policy model performance with remarkable
data efficiency, requiring only a 20K-sample training dataset. Our code will be
released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: TURA is a new framework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content and dynamic, real-time information, addressing the limitations of traditional RAG approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time needs and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated content. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static content, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like databases and real-time APIs.

Method: TURA (Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage framework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content and dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an Intent-Aware Retrieval module, a DAG-based Task Planner, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor.

Result: TURA leverages an agentic framework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency demands of a large-scale industrial system, serving tens of millions of users.

Conclusion: TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge the gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI search product, delivering robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency demands of a large-scale industrial system.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines
into conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant
industrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time
needs and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated
content like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static
pages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such
time-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static
content, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like
databases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA
(Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage
framework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content
and dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an
Intent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information
sources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task
Planner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for
optimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for
efficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge
the gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI
search product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic
framework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency
demands of a large-scale industrial system.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper finds the over-memorization phenomenon during LLM finetuning, which hurts robustness, generalization, and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The pretrained large language models (LLMs) are finetuned with labeled data for better instruction following ability and alignment with human values.

Method: study the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning on reasoning tasks and reveal the uncovered over-memorization phenomenon during a specific stage of LLM finetuning. They investigate the conditions that lead to LLM over-memorization and find that training epochs and large learning rates contribute to this issue.

Result: LLMs have excessively memorized training data and exhibit high test perplexity while maintaining good test accuracy. Models with over-memorization demonstrate comparable test accuracy to normal models, but they suffer from reduced robustness, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and decreased generation diversity. The over-memorization is broadly applicable across different tasks, models, and finetuning methods.

Conclusion: Overparameterized, extensively finetuned LLMs exhibit unique learning dynamics distinct from traditional machine learning models. Based on our observations of over-memorization, the authors provide recommendations on checkpoint and learning rate selection during finetuning.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种高效的数据选择方法，通过选择更具挑战性的偏好数据来提升LLM对齐效果，仅用少量数据就胜过现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作缺乏专门针对偏好数据的高质量数据选择方法，而对齐大型语言模型（LLM）与人类偏好是人工智能研究中的一项关键挑战。

Method: 该研究提出了一种基于DPO隐式奖励机制的难度数据选择策略。

Result: 该方法在多个数据集和对齐任务中始终优于五个强大的基线，仅使用原始数据的10％即可实现卓越的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于难度的偏好数据集选择策略，通过选择DPO隐式奖励差距较小的偏好数据样本来提高数据效率和模型对齐。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is a critical
challenge in AI research. While methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are widely used, they
often rely on large, costly preference datasets. The current work lacks methods
for high-quality data selection specifically for preference data. In this work,
we introduce a novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference
datasets, grounded in the DPO implicit reward mechanism. By selecting
preference data examples with smaller DPO implicit reward gaps, which are
indicative of more challenging cases, we improve data efficiency and model
alignment. Our approach consistently outperforms five strong baselines across
multiple datasets and alignment tasks, achieving superior performance with only
10\% of the original data. This principled, efficient selection method offers a
promising solution for scaling LLM alignment with limited resources.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，主观评估表明TTS取得了快速进展，但当前的TTS系统真的可以通过类图灵评估中的人类欺骗测试吗？

Method: 大规模评估开源和商业TTS模型

Result: (i)基于CMOS的人类对等性声明在欺骗测试中经常失败，(ii)TTS进展应该在人类语音达到高HFR的数据集上进行基准测试，因为针对单调或表达力较差的参考样本进行评估会降低标准，(iii)商业模型在零样本设置中接近人类欺骗，而开源系统仍然在自然的会话语音中挣扎；(iv)在高质量数据上进行微调可以提高真实感，但不能完全弥合差距。

Conclusion: 需要更逼真、以人为本的评估，以及现有的主观测试。

Abstract: While subjective evaluations in recent years indicate rapid progress in TTS,
can current TTS systems truly pass a human deception test in a Turing-like
evaluation? We introduce Human Fooling Rate (HFR), a metric that directly
measures how often machine-generated speech is mistaken for human. Our
large-scale evaluation of open-source and commercial TTS models reveals
critical insights: (i) CMOS-based claims of human parity often fail under
deception testing, (ii) TTS progress should be benchmarked on datasets where
human speech achieves high HFRs, as evaluating against monotonous or less
expressive reference samples sets a low bar, (iii) Commercial models approach
human deception in zero-shot settings, while open-source systems still struggle
with natural conversational speech; (iv) Fine-tuning on high-quality data
improves realism but does not fully bridge the gap. Our findings underscore the
need for more realistic, human-centric evaluations alongside existing
subjective tests.

Motivation: 多模态大型语言模型 (MLLM) 在视觉语言任务中表现出了令人印象深刻的能力。然而，它们可能会出现幻觉——产生与输入图像或文本在语义上不一致的输出。

Method: 该研究提出了一种由因果完备性引导的强化学习框架，该框架共同考虑了token的因果充分性和因果必要性。该框架在 GRPO 优化框架内构建了一个因果信息优势函数，鼓励模型关注对准确生成具有因果充分性和必要性的token。

Result: 在各种基准数据集和任务上的实验结果证明了该方法的有效性，该方法有效地缓解了 MLLM 中的幻觉。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的强化学习框架，该框架以因果完备性为指导，旨在解决多模态大型语言模型 (MLLM) 中的幻觉问题，并通过实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across vision-language tasks. However, they may suffer from
hallucinations--generating outputs that are semantically inconsistent with the
input image or text. Through causal analyses, we find that: (i) hallucinations
with omission may arise from the failure to adequately capture essential causal
factors, and (ii) hallucinations with fabrication are likely caused by the
model being misled by non-causal cues. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel reinforcement learning framework guided by causal completeness, which
jointly considers both causal sufficiency and causal necessity of tokens.
Specifically, we evaluate each token's standalone contribution and
counterfactual indispensability to define a token-level causal completeness
reward. This reward is used to construct a causally informed advantage function
within the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on
tokens that are both causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation.
Experimental results across various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach, which effectively mitigates hallucinations
in MLLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Information tasks such as writing surveys or analytical reports require complex search and reasoning, and have recently been grouped under the umbrella of deep research but the scope of the deep research task remains underdefined and its distinction from other reasoning-intensive problems is poorly understood.

Method: propose a formal characterization of the deep research (DR) task and introduce a benchmark to evaluate the performance of DR systems. define DR using an intermediate output representation that encodes key claims uncovered during search-separating the reasoning challenge from surface-level report generation. propose a diverse, challenging benchmark LiveDRBench with 100 challenging tasks over scientific topics and public interest events.

Result: Across state-of-the-art DR systems, F1 score ranges between 0.02 and 0.72 for any sub-category. OpenAI's model performs the best with an overall F1 score of 0.55.

Conclusion: Analysis of reasoning traces reveals the distribution over the number of referenced sources, branching, and backtracking events executed by current DR systems, motivating future directions for improving their search mechanisms and grounding capabilities.

Abstract: Information tasks such as writing surveys or analytical reports require
complex search and reasoning, and have recently been grouped under the umbrella
of \textit{deep research} -- a term also adopted by recent models targeting
these capabilities. Despite growing interest, the scope of the deep research
task remains underdefined and its distinction from other reasoning-intensive
problems is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a formal
characterization of the deep research (DR) task and introduce a benchmark to
evaluate the performance of DR systems. We argue that the core defining feature
of deep research is not the production of lengthy report-style outputs, but
rather the high fan-out over concepts required during the search process, i.e.,
broad and reasoning-intensive exploration. To enable objective evaluation, we
define DR using an intermediate output representation that encodes key claims
uncovered during search-separating the reasoning challenge from surface-level
report generation. Based on this formulation, we propose a diverse, challenging
benchmark LiveDRBench with 100 challenging tasks over scientific topics (e.g.,
datasets, materials discovery, prior art search) and public interest events
(e.g., flight incidents, movie awards). Across state-of-the-art DR systems, F1
score ranges between 0.02 and 0.72 for any sub-category. OpenAI's model
performs the best with an overall F1 score of 0.55. Analysis of reasoning
traces reveals the distribution over the number of referenced sources,
branching, and backtracking events executed by current DR systems, motivating
future directions for improving their search mechanisms and grounding
capabilities. The benchmark is available at

TL;DR: Language models are vulnerable to conversational manipulation, leading to misaligned behaviors. A new evaluation framework, MISALIGNMENTBENCH, demonstrates high vulnerability rates across frontier LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art language models are vulnerable to carefully crafted conversational scenarios that can induce various forms of misalignment without explicit jailbreaking.

Method: Systematic manual red-teaming and automated evaluation framework (MISALIGNMENTBENCH).

Result: Discovered 10 successful attack scenarios with Claude-4-Opus, revealing vulnerabilities in narrative immersion, emotional pressure, and strategic framing. Cross-model evaluation revealed an overall 76% vulnerability rate.

Conclusion: Current alignment strategies have critical gaps and need robustness against subtle, scenario-based manipulation.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in alignment techniques, we demonstrate that
state-of-the-art language models remain vulnerable to carefully crafted
conversational scenarios that can induce various forms of misalignment without
explicit jailbreaking. Through systematic manual red-teaming with
Claude-4-Opus, we discovered 10 successful attack scenarios, revealing
fundamental vulnerabilities in how current alignment methods handle narrative
immersion, emotional pressure, and strategic framing. These scenarios
successfully elicited a range of misaligned behaviors, including deception,
value drift, self-preservation, and manipulative reasoning, each exploiting
different psychological and contextual vulnerabilities. To validate
generalizability, we distilled our successful manual attacks into
MISALIGNMENTBENCH, an automated evaluation framework that enables reproducible
testing across multiple models. Cross-model evaluation of our 10 scenarios
against five frontier LLMs revealed an overall 76% vulnerability rate, with
significant variations: GPT-4.1 showed the highest susceptibility (90%), while
Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrated greater resistance (40%). Our findings demonstrate
that sophisticated reasoning capabilities often become attack vectors rather
than protective mechanisms, as models can be manipulated into complex
justifications for misaligned behavior. This work provides (i) a detailed
taxonomy of conversational manipulation patterns and (ii) a reusable evaluation
framework. Together, these findings expose critical gaps in current alignment
strategies and highlight the need for robustness against subtle, scenario-based
manipulation in future AI systems.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis in low-resource, culturally nuanced contexts challenges
conventional NLP approaches that assume fixed labels and universal affective
expressions. We present a diagnostic framework that treats sentiment as a
context-dependent, culturally embedded construct, and evaluate how large
language models (LLMs) reason about sentiment in informal, code-mixed WhatsApp
messages from Nairobi youth health groups. Using a combination of
human-annotated data, sentiment-flipped counterfactuals, and rubric-based
explanation evaluation, we probe LLM interpretability, robustness, and
alignment with human reasoning. Framing our evaluation through a social-science
measurement lens, we operationalize and interrogate LLMs outputs as an
instrument for measuring the abstract concept of sentiment. Our findings reveal
significant variation in model reasoning quality, with top-tier LLMs
demonstrating interpretive stability, while open models often falter under
ambiguity or sentiment shifts. This work highlights the need for culturally

TL;DR: ReasoningGuard is proposed to safeguard Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) from generating harmful content by injecting timely safety aha moments and using a scaling sampling strategy, achieving state-of-the-art safety defenses with minimal extra inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in reasoning-intensive tasks, but they remain vulnerable to harmful content generation, particularly in the mid-to-late steps of their reasoning processes. Existing defense mechanisms, however, rely on costly fine-tuning and additional expert knowledge, which restricts their scalability.

Method: ReasoningGuard, an inference-time safeguard for LRMs, which injects timely safety aha moments to steer harmless while helpful reasoning processes. Leveraging the model's internal attention behavior, our approach accurately identifies critical points in the reasoning path, and triggers spontaneous, safety-oriented reflection. To safeguard both the subsequent reasoning steps and the final answers, we further implement a scaling sampling strategy during the decoding phase, selecting the optimal reasoning path.

Result: ReasoningGuard outperforms seven existing safeguards, achieving state-of-the-art safety defenses while effectively avoiding the common exaggerated safety issues.

Conclusion: ReasoningGuard effectively mitigates three types of jailbreak attacks, achieving state-of-the-art safety defenses while effectively avoiding the common exaggerated safety issues.

TL;DR: This paper explores using black box LLMs for hierarchical text classification, finding that few-shot learning and the DH strategy can be effective but also costly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HTC faces challenges due to data scarcity and model complexity, motivating the exploration of black box LLMs as an alternative to traditional methods.

Method: The study evaluates three prompting strategies (DL, DH, TMH) in zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing their accuracy and cost-effectiveness.

Result: Few-shot learning improves accuracy. LLMs, especially DH, outperform traditional models on deeper hierarchies, but API costs increase with DH. Trade-offs exist between accuracy and cost.

Conclusion: Black box LLMs hold promise for HTC, but prompt strategy selection is crucial for balancing performance and cost.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) aims to assign texts to structured
label hierarchies; however, it faces challenges due to data scarcity and model
complexity. This study explores the feasibility of using black box Large
Language Models (LLMs) accessed via APIs for HTC, as an alternative to
traditional machine learning methods that require extensive labeled data and
computational resources. We evaluate three prompting strategies -- Direct Leaf
Label Prediction (DL), Direct Hierarchical Label Prediction (DH), and Top-down
Multi-step Hierarchical Label Prediction (TMH) -- in both zero-shot and
few-shot settings, comparing the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of these
strategies. Experiments on two datasets show that a few-shot setting
consistently improves classification accuracy compared to a zero-shot setting.
While a traditional machine learning model achieves high accuracy on a dataset
with a shallow hierarchy, LLMs, especially DH strategy, tend to outperform the
machine learning model on a dataset with a deeper hierarchy. API costs increase
significantly due to the higher input tokens required for deeper label
hierarchies on DH strategy. These results emphasize the trade-off between
accuracy improvement and the computational cost of prompt strategy. These
findings highlight the potential of black box LLMs for HTC while underscoring
the need to carefully select a prompt strategy to balance performance and cost.

Result: outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in time series forecasting

Conclusion: incorporating textual context via a dual-prompt mechanism to achieve more accurate time series predictions

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial in strategic planning and decision-making
across various industries. Traditional forecasting models mainly concentrate on
numerical time series data, often overlooking important textual information
such as events and news, which can significantly affect forecasting accuracy.
While large language models offer a promise for integrating multimodal data,
existing single-prompt frameworks struggle to effectively capture the semantics
of timestamped text, introducing redundant information that can hinder model
performance. To address this limitation, we introduce DP-GPT4MTS (Dual-Prompt
GPT2-base for Multimodal Time Series), a novel dual-prompt large language model
framework that combines two complementary prompts: an explicit prompt for clear
task instructions and a textual prompt for context-aware embeddings from
time-stamped data. The tokenizer generates the explicit prompt while the
embeddings from the textual prompt are refined through self-attention and
feed-forward networks. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse
textural-numerical time series datasets demonstrate that this approach
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in time series forecasting. This
highlights the significance of incorporating textual context via a dual-prompt
mechanism to achieve more accurate time series predictions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces KVSink, a method that effectively predicts sink tokens with negligible overhead, enabling more thorough preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N (PFN) strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies have emphasized the importance of preserving the original precision of KVs for the first few tokens to ensure the protection of attention sinks. While this approach has proven effective in mitigating performance degradation, its underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, it fails to address the recent discovery that attention sinks can emerge beyond the initial token positions.

Method: introduce KVSink, a plug-and-play method that effectively predicts sink tokens with negligible overhead, enabling more thorough preservation

Result: KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N (PFN) strategy, offering more effective preservation of attention sinks during KV cache quantization. Moreover, when applied to the well-established KVQuant method, KVSink further improves perplexity (PPL) and reduces reliance on 16-bit numerical outliers.

Conclusion: KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N (PFN) strategy, offering more effective preservation of attention sinks during KV cache quantization. Moreover, when applied to the well-established KVQuant method, KVSink further improves perplexity (PPL) and reduces reliance on 16-bit numerical outliers.

Abstract: Key-Value (KV) cache quantization has become a widely adopted optimization
technique for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by reducing KV
cache memory usage and mitigating memory-bound constraints. Recent studies have
emphasized the importance of preserving the original precision of KVs for the
first few tokens to ensure the protection of attention sinks. While this
approach has proven effective in mitigating performance degradation, its
underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, it fails to
address the recent discovery that attention sinks can emerge beyond the initial
token positions. In this work, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of
attention sinks during inference by examining their role in the cross-layer
evolution of extreme activation outliers. Additionally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of the interplay between attention sinks and KV cache
quantization. Based on our enhanced understanding, we introduce
\textit{\textbf{KVSink}}, a plug-and-play method that effectively predicts sink
tokens with negligible overhead, enabling more thorough preservation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N

Motivation: Existing e-commerce benchmarks primarily focus on basic user intents. However, real-world users often pursue more complex goals.

Method: Propose a trajectory distillation strategy and leverage supervised fine-tuning, along with reinforcement learning on synthetic trajectories, to distill the capabilities of a large language agent into a smaller one.

Result: State-of-the-art language agents achieve absolute success rates under 50% on ShoppingBench tasks.

Conclusion: Trained agent achieves competitive performance compared to GPT-4.1.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks in e-commerce primarily focus on basic user intents, such
as finding or purchasing products. However, real-world users often pursue more
complex goals, such as applying vouchers, managing budgets, and finding
multi-products seller. To bridge this gap, we propose ShoppingBench, a novel
end-to-end shopping benchmark designed to encompass increasingly challenging
levels of grounded intent. Specifically, we propose a scalable framework to
simulate user instructions based on various intents derived from sampled
real-world products. To facilitate consistent and reliable evaluations, we
provide a large-scale shopping sandbox that serves as an interactive simulated
environment, incorporating over 2.5 million real-world products. Experimental
results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art language agents (such as
GPT-4.1) achieve absolute success rates under 50% on our benchmark tasks,
highlighting the significant challenges posed by our ShoppingBench. In
addition, we propose a trajectory distillation strategy and leverage supervised
fine-tuning, along with reinforcement learning on synthetic trajectories, to
distill the capabilities of a large language agent into a smaller one. As a
result, our trained agent achieves competitive performance compared to GPT-4.1.

*Jiayi Wen,Tianxin Chen,Zhirun Zheng,Cheng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies and demonstrates knowledge poisoning attacks on GraphRAG, showing that even small modifications to the source text can significantly degrade performance and current defenses are ineffective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GraphRAG relies on LLMs to extract knowledge from raw text during graph construction, and this process can be maliciously manipulated to implant misleading information.

Method: two knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs): Targeted KPA (TKPA) and Universal KPA (UKPA)

Result: modifying only a few words in the source text can significantly change the constructed graph, poison the GraphRAG, and severely mislead downstream reasoning. TKPA achieves precise control over specific question-answering (QA) outcomes with a success rate of 93.1%, while keeping the poisoned text fluent and natural. With fewer than 0.05% of full text modified, the QA accuracy collapses from 95% to 50% with UKPA.

Conclusion: state-of-the-art defense methods fail to detect these attacks, highlighting that securing GraphRAG pipelines against knowledge poisoning remains largely unexplored.

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has recently emerged as
a promising paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by converting
raw text into structured knowledge graphs, improving both accuracy and
explainability. However, GraphRAG relies on LLMs to extract knowledge from raw
text during graph construction, and this process can be maliciously manipulated
to implant misleading information. Targeting this attack surface, we propose
two knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs) and demonstrate that modifying only a
few words in the source text can significantly change the constructed graph,
poison the GraphRAG, and severely mislead downstream reasoning. The first
attack, named Targeted KPA (TKPA), utilizes graph-theoretic analysis to locate
vulnerable nodes in the generated graphs and rewrites the corresponding
narratives with LLMs, achieving precise control over specific
question-answering (QA) outcomes with a success rate of 93.1\%, while keeping
the poisoned text fluent and natural. The second attack, named Universal KPA
(UKPA), exploits linguistic cues such as pronouns and dependency relations to
disrupt the structural integrity of the generated graph by altering globally
influential words. With fewer than 0.05\% of full text modified, the QA
accuracy collapses from 95\% to 50\%. Furthermore, experiments show that
state-of-the-art defense methods fail to detect these attacks, highlighting
that securing GraphRAG pipelines against knowledge poisoning remains largely
unexplored.

TL;DR: MedCheck是一个评估框架，用于诊断医疗LLM基准测试中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在医疗保健中显示出巨大的潜力，促使人们进行了大量基准测试来评估它们的能力。然而，人们仍然担心这些基准的可靠性，因为这些基准通常缺乏临床保真度、强大的数据管理和以安全为导向的评估指标。

Method: 我们提出了MedCheck，这是第一个面向生命周期的评估框架，专门为医疗基准设计。

Result: 我们的分析发现普遍存在的系统性问题，包括与临床实践的深刻脱节，由于未减轻的污染风险导致的数据完整性危机，以及对模型鲁棒性和不确定性意识等安全关键评估维度的系统性忽视。

Conclusion: MedCheck可以作为现有基准的诊断工具，并为在医疗保健中评估AI提供更标准化、可靠和透明的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in healthcare,
prompting numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, concerns
persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack
clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation
metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first
lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical
benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five
continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive
checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an
in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis
uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from
clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination
risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like
model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck
serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable
guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to
evaluating AI in healthcare.

### [46] [GTPO and GRPO-S: Token and Sequence-Level Reward Shaping with Policy Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04349)
*Hongze Tan,Jianfei Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces entropy weighting to improve reward signals in RL for LLMs, leading to better reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL algorithms like GRPO suffer from coarse-grained credit assignment, applying a uniform reward to all tokens, which is flawed in long-chain reasoning tasks.

Method: The paper introduces Dynamic Entropy Weighting, including Group Token Policy Optimization (GTPO) and Sequence-Level Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO-S), to assign entropy-weighted rewards for fine-grained credit assignment.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed entropy-weighting mechanism significantly outperforms the DAPO baseline, enhancing deep reasoning in models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with algorithms like Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) improves Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, but is
limited by a coarse-grained credit assignment that applies a uniform reward to
all tokens in a sequence. This is a major flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks.
This paper solves this with \textbf{Dynamic Entropy Weighting}. Our core idea
is that high-entropy tokens in correct responses can guide the policy toward a
higher performance ceiling. This allows us to create more fine-grained reward
signals for precise policy updates via two ways: 1) \textbf{Group Token Policy
Optimization} (\textbf{GTPO}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each
token for fine-grained credit assignment. 2) \textbf{Sequence-Level Group
Relative Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GRPO-S}), we assigns a entropy-weighted
reward to each sequence based on its average token entropy. Experiments show
our methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline. The results
confirm that our entropy-weighting mechanism is the key driver of this
performance boost, offering a better path to enhance deep reasoning in models.

Conclusion: The Chain of Questions (CoQ) method improves a foundation model's ability to effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information, leading to improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process with diverse multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially
advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step
explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to
multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory
modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when
interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce
the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach
that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted
questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the
model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical
information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We
evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by
integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to
effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to
improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process
with diverse multimodal tasks.

Motivation: developing VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to the time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging instructional content.

Method: leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two core components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the text, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated demonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment.

Result: an instruction generator creates training content using relevant data from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by changing the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate tasks.

Conclusion: This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development overhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving industrial needs.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for workforce training,
offering immersive, interactive, and risk-free environments that enhance skill
acquisition, decision-making, and confidence. Despite its advantages,
developing VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to
the time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging
instructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a
novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the
generation of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two
core components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the
text, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated
demonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module
receives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.
Based on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant
data from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by
changing the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate
tasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development
overhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving

Motivation: 当要预测的点集有噪声时，这些算法的有效性会大大降低。为了缓解这个问题，通常在圆拟合程序之前应用离群点检测和移除算法。

Method: 该方法首先将点集转换为极坐标，然后计算局部和全局标准偏差。通过将局部平均值与全局标准偏差进行比较来识别异常值。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于极坐标的离群点检测 (PCOD) 算法，该算法在数据集的精度方面优于其他方法，展示了其在增强工业环境中的圆拟合应用方面的潜力。

Abstract: Circle fitting methods are extensively utilized in various industries,
particularly in quality control processes and design applications. The
effectiveness of these algorithms can be significantly compromised when the
point sets to be predicted are noisy. To mitigate this issue, outlier detection
and removal algorithms are often applied before the circle fitting procedure.
This study introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD)
algorithm, which can be effectively employed in circle fitting applications. In
the proposed approach, the point set is first transformed into polar
coordinates, followed by the calculation of both local and global standard
deviations. Outliers are then identified by comparing local mean values with
the global standard deviation. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed
method are demonstrated by focusing on the high-precision diameter measurement
of industrial washer parts. Images from a machine vision system are processed
through preprocessing steps, including sub-pixel edge detection. The resulting
sub-pixel edge points are then cleaned using the proposed outlier detection and
removal algorithm, after which circle fitting is performed. A comparison is
made using ten different circle fitting algorithms and five distinct outlier
detection methods. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms
the other approaches, delivering the best performance in terms of accuracy
within the dataset, thereby demonstrating its potential for enhancing circle
fitting applications in industrial environments.

Motivation: 在相机测量系统中，通常采用远心镜头等专用设备来测量具有窄公差的零件。然而，尽管使用了此类设备，但由于系统内部的机械和软件相关因素，仍可能发生测量误差。这些误差在使用相同设置测量不同直径的零件的应用中尤为明显。

Conclusion: 通过使用少量已知参考零件，该方法能够对相机视野内的所有零件进行高精度测量。此外，该方法通过显著降低误差率和提高测量可靠性，从而提升了现有直径测量文献。

Abstract: In camera measurement systems, specialized equipment such as telecentric
lenses is often employed to measure parts with narrow tolerances. However,
despite the use of such equipment, measurement errors can occur due to
mechanical and software-related factors within the system. These errors are
particularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are
measured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to
enhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion
factor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the
conversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter
(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly
estimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The
experimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.
Tests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show
that measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were
reduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods. By utilizing only a few
known reference parts, the proposed approach enables high-accuracy measurement
of all parts within the camera's field of view. Additionally, this method
enhances the existing diameter measurement literature by significantly reducing
error rates and improving measurement reliability.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLM4-IC8K, a novel framework that leverages LLMs for structured geometric interpretation of IC mechanical drawings, and a multi-modal dataset ICGeo8K with 8,608 labeled samples. The model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling of integrated circuits (IC) remain highly challenging due to unstructured footprint drawing and abstract diagram annotations, and no methods currently exist for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings.

Method: A two-stage framework is proposed: first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint diagrams, then fine-tunes them on real-world datasheet drawings.

Result: Current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry labeling problem. The proposed LLM4-IC8K model addresses three sub-tasks: perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin, and estimating the dimensions of individual pins.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM4-IC8K model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the ICGeo8K benchmark.

Abstract: Printed-Circuit-board (PCB) footprint geometry labeling of integrated
circuits (IC) is essential in defining the physical interface between
components and the PCB layout, requiring exceptional visual perception
proficiency. However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract
diagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling
remain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist
for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings.
In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our
findings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric
perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry
labeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel
framework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for
structured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning
approach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks:
perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin,
and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage
framework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint
diagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on
real-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical
scenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with
8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and
4470 synthetically generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark.

Abstract: Thermal infrared imaging exhibits considerable potentials for robotic
perception tasks, especially in environments with poor visibility or
challenging lighting conditions. However, TIR images typically suffer from
heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object
detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a
diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space
representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable
diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function
combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex
wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded
refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising
results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of
our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our
method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging
real-world TIR datasets, underscoring its effectiveness for practical robotic
deployment.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning-based approach achieves a macro IoU of 65.3%, significantly surpassing the erroneous maps baseline (40.1%), an RF-only method (37.3%), and a non-AI fusion baseline (42.2%).

Abstract: Environment mapping is an important computing task for a wide range of smart
city applications, including autonomous navigation, wireless network operations
and extended reality environments. Conventional smart city mapping techniques,
such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer
from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source
mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence
applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth.
However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments
introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks
trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach
that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by
combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data
collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our
approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process
both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing
spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For
the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei.
We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss
information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to
three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard
index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff
distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of
65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields
40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and
(iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes VQ-DeepISC, a vector quantized digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image transmission. It uses a Swin Transformer backbone for feature extraction and VQ modules for discrete latent space projection.  The system outperforms benchmark methods in reconstruction fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discretization of semantic features enables interoperability between semantic and digital communication systems, showing significant potential for practical applications. The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring robustness to channel degradation.

Method: a vector quantized (VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook updates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard.

Result: superior reconstruction fidelity of the proposed system over benchmark methods

Conclusion: Experimental results demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity of the proposed system over benchmark methods.

Abstract: Recent interest in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has fostered a
wide range of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep
learning, for geospatial problem solving. However, major challenges such as a

present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved
by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of
geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection
pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance.
Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that

Abstract: Accurately estimating urban rail platform occupancy can enhance transit
agencies' ability to make informed operational decisions, thereby improving
safety, operational efficiency, and customer experience, particularly in the
context of crowding. However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging
and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or
staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has
emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate,
real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential
by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting
crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and
counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification
via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic
segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly
efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the
generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus,
for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving
dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our
results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive
value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data,
independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable
more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational
responses for platform crowding mitigation.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models for automated invoice processing
is critically dependent on large-scale, diverse datasets. However, the
acquisition of such datasets is often constrained by privacy regulations and
the high cost of manual annotation. To address this, we present a novel
pipeline for generating high-fidelity, synthetic invoice documents and their
corresponding structured data. Our method first utilizes Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) to extract the text content and precise spatial layout from a
source invoice. Select data fields are then replaced with contextually
realistic, synthetic content generated by a large language model (LLM).
Finally, we employ an inpainting technique to erase the original text from the
image and render the new, synthetic text in its place, preserving the exact
layout and font characteristics. This process yields a pair of outputs: a
visually realistic new invoice image and a perfectly aligned structured data
file (JSON) reflecting the synthetic content. Our approach provides a scalable
and automated solution to amplify small, private datasets, enabling the
creation of large, varied corpora for training more robust and accurate
document intelligence models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Refine-IQA, a multi-stage RFT framework for image quality assessment that strengthens visual quality perception and supervises the think process, achieving outstanding performance on perception, scoring, and quality interpreting tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RFT-based IQA methods provide no reward supervision for the think process and do not explicitly enhance the model's native low-level visual quality perception.

Method: The multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA) with multi-task reward functions and a probability difference reward involved strategy.

Result: The Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both perception and scoring tasks and attains exceptional results on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

Conclusion: The Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both perception and scoring tasks, and the paradigm activates a robust quality interpreting capability.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training.
Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to
low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing
RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the
model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process,
leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods
typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly
enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may
constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose
the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the
Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907
locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task
reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In
Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability
difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The
resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both
perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust
"think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results
on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The
four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with
high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical
bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift,
and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably
corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements.
Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to
provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet,
an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net
and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center
correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on
large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift
magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to
experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations
demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during
denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection
task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked
against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise
suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating
high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated
characterization.

Abstract: Impact craters are among the most prominent geomorphological features on
planetary surfaces and are of substantial significance in planetary science
research. Their spatial distribution and morphological characteristics provide
critical information on planetary surface composition, geological history, and
impact processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning

paper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater
detection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a
framework that features a two-stage approach where the first stage features
crater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet-50 and YOLO. In the
second stage, our framework employs YOLO-based detection for crater
localisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and
present a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We
consider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon
based on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the
most balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in

Abstract: We propose a diffusion model designed to generate point-based shape
representations with correspondences. Traditional statistical shape models have
considered point correspondences extensively, but current deep learning methods
do not take them into account, focusing on unordered point clouds instead.
Current deep generative models for point clouds do not address generating
shapes with point correspondences between generated shapes. This work aims to
formulate a diffusion model that is capable of generating realistic point-based
shape representations, which preserve point correspondences that are present in
the training data. Using shape representation data with correspondences derived
from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), we demonstrate that our
correspondence-preserving model effectively generates point-based hippocampal
shape representations that are highly realistic compared to existing methods.
We further demonstrate the applications of our generative model by downstream
tasks, such as conditional generation of healthy and AD subjects and predicting

Motivation: 放射科医生经常混合使用医学图像阅读策略，包括检查单个模态和局部图像区域，独立和同时使用来自不同图像的不同位置的信息。

Method: 训练一个策略网络，通过推荐最佳成像方式和感兴趣的特定部分来辅助肿瘤定位。在训练过程中，一个预先训练的分割网络模仿放射科医生对这些成像方式及其部分的单独或可变组合的检查（由策略网络选择）。

Result: 使用来自前列腺癌患者的 1325 个标记的多参数 MRI 图像的数据集验证了该方法，证明了其提高注释效率和分割准确性的潜力，尤其是在存在具有挑战性的病理时。实验结果表明，该方法可以超过标准分割网络。

Conclusion: 该方法优于标准分割网络，并可能为放射科医生提供辅助。

Abstract: Radiologists often mix medical image reading strategies, including inspection
of individual modalities and local image regions, using information at
different locations from different images independently as well as
concurrently. In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine
learning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions
along with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation
performance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists
tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the
specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained
segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable
combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the
policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next
step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best
localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled
multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its
potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy,
especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show
that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more
interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal
strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist
guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising
interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human
radiologists.

*Mamadou Keita,Wassim Hamidouche,Hessen Bougueffa Eutamene,Abdelmalik Taleb-Ahmed,Abdenour Hadid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAVID is a new AI-generated image detection framework that uses visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve accuracy and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-generated image detection methods struggle with generalization and robustness and often rely on low-level artifacts. Visual knowledge is underexplored in RAG methods.

Method: The paper introduces RAVID, a framework that uses a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder (RAVID CLIP) with category-related prompts and integrates a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the query image.

Result: RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85% on the UniversalFakeDetect benchmark and maintains high accuracy even under image degradations, achieving 80.27% accuracy compared to 63.44% for C2P-CLIP.

Conclusion: RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, with an average accuracy of 93.85%, and demonstrates robustness under image degradations, achieving an average accuracy of 80.27% compared to 63.44% for C2P-CLIP.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce RAVID, the first framework for AI-generated image
detection that leverages visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While RAG
methods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation
models, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge
underexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with
generalization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and
model-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID
dynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach
utilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with
category-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further
integrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the
query, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID
generates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images
from a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched
input for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the
UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that
RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%.
RAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining
high accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under
degradation conditions, compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model
C2P-CLIP, demonstrating consistent improvements in both Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种两阶段训练方法，以减少对人工管理的需求，并扩大音频同步视觉动画的规模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法严重依赖昂贵的手动管理的高质量、特定类别的训练视频，这对在开放世界中扩展到不同的音视频类别提出了挑战。

Method: 我们提出了一种高效的两阶段训练范例，以使用丰富但嘈杂的视频来扩大音频同步视觉动画的规模。

Result: 我们的方法在很大程度上减少了对手动管理的依赖，超过 10 倍，同时推广到许多开放类别。我们引入了 AVSync48，这是一个包含 48 个类别的视频的基准，比以前的基准多样性高 3 倍。

Conclusion: 该方法显著减少了对人工干预的依赖，超过 10 倍，同时推广到许多开放类别。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-synchronized visual animation enable control of
video content using audios from specific classes. However, existing methods
rely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific
training videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes
in the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training
paradigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but
noisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for
pretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video
alignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated
high-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the
required human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each
frame to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window
attention. To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video
generator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\% additional trainable
parameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the
generator's prior knowledge. For evaluation, we introduce AVSync48, a benchmark
with videos from 48 classes, which is 3$\times$ more diverse than previous
benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces
reliance on manual curation by over 10$\times$, while generalizing to many open
classes.

TL;DR: PDSSNet addresses challenges in remote sensing image segmentation by unifying class representations and distinguishing similar features using a prototype-driven approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High intra-class variance and high inter-class similarity in semantic segmentation of remote sensing images hinder the acquisition of complete ground objects.

Method: a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network (PDSSNet) with three key modules: Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM), Semantic-Structure Coordination Module (SSCM), and Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM).

Result: PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, acquiring complete
ground objects is critical for achieving precise analysis. However, this task
is severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and
high inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete
segmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class
representations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging
class-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations
and a neglect of target structural information.
  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network
(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete
ground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its
variant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key
modules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures
semantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract
unbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure
Coordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,
structure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic
cognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the
semantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.
Finally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic
step-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between
classes.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art
methods. The source code is available at

Motivation: 将提示学习应用于下游图像-文本检索(ITR)任务更具挑战性。挑战在于区分下游数据的细粒度属性和相似的子类别。

Method: 提出了具有联合类别-属性重新加权的对偶提示学习(DCAR)。

Result: 在FDRD上进行了大量实验，证明DCAR实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DCAR在FDRD上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Recently, prompt learning has demonstrated remarkable success in adapting
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks such as
image classification. However, its application to the downstream Image-Text
Retrieval (ITR) task is more challenging. We find that the challenge lies in
discriminating both fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories of the
downstream data. To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning
with Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning
framework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically
adjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the
performance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm,
DCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained
representation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it
dynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image
mutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces
negative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to
learn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the
Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging
benchmark for ITR in downstream data domains. It covers over 1,500 downstream
fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs with detailed attribute
annotations. Extensive experiments on FDRD demonstrate that DCAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines.

TL;DR: Investigate the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance of deep learning models for nutritional estimation using only 2D images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating the nutritional content of food from images is a critical task with significant implications for health and dietary monitoring. Reproducibility in this domain is hampered by the reliance of state-of-the-art methods on proprietary datasets for large-scale pre-training.

Method: Fine-tune and evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on two large public datasets, ImageNet and COYO, comparing their performance against baseline CNN models (InceptionV2 and ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method pre-trained on the proprietary JFT-300M dataset.

Result: Models pre-trained on JFT-300M significantly outperform those pre-trained on public datasets. The model pre-trained on the massive COYO dataset performs worse than the model pre-trained on ImageNet.

Conclusion: Pre-training dataset characteristics, including scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, are critical for effective transfer learning in 2D nutritional estimation.

Abstract: Estimating the nutritional content of food from images is a critical task
with significant implications for health and dietary monitoring. This is
challenging, especially when relying solely on 2D images, due to the
variability in food presentation, lighting, and the inherent difficulty in
inferring volume and mass without depth information. Furthermore,
reproducibility in this domain is hampered by the reliance of state-of-the-art
methods on proprietary datasets for large-scale pre-training. In this paper, we
investigate the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance
of deep learning models for nutritional estimation using only 2D images. We
fine-tune and evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on two large
public datasets, ImageNet and COYO, comparing their performance against
baseline CNN models (InceptionV2 and ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method
pre-trained on the proprietary JFT-300M dataset. We conduct extensive
experiments on the Nutrition5k dataset, a large-scale collection of real-world
food plates with high-precision nutritional annotations. Our evaluation using
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAE%) reveals
that models pre-trained on JFT-300M significantly outperform those pre-trained
on public datasets. Unexpectedly, the model pre-trained on the massive COYO
dataset performs worse than the model pre-trained on ImageNet for this specific
regression task, refuting our initial hypothesis. Our analysis provides
quantitative evidence highlighting the critical role of pre-training dataset
characteristics, including scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, for
effective transfer learning in 2D nutritional estimation.

TL;DR: JanusNet是一种用于3D医学数据的数据增强框架，它全局建模解剖学连续性，同时局部关注难以分割的区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于训练样本和注释的稀缺性，弱监督医学图像分割通常采用数据增强来增加数据多样性，而随机混合体积块已证明具有强大的性能。然而，这种方法破坏了3D医学图像沿正交轴的固有解剖学连续性，导致严重的结构不一致和具有挑战性的区域（如小尺寸器官等）的训练不足。

Method: Slice-Block Shuffle步骤沿随机轴执行跨卷的相同索引切片块的对齐混洗，同时保留垂直于扰动轴的平面上的解剖学上下文。置信度引导的位移步骤使用预测可靠性来替换每个切片中的块，从而放大来自困难区域的信号。

Result: JanusNet显著超过了最先进的方法，例如，在Synapse数据集上仅使用20%的标记数据就获得了4%的DSC增益。

Conclusion: JanusNet在Synapse和AMOS数据集上显著超过了最先进的方法，例如，在Synapse数据集上仅使用20%的标记数据就获得了4%的DSC增益。

Abstract: Limited by the scarcity of training samples and annotations, weakly
supervised medical image segmentation often employs data augmentation to
increase data diversity, while randomly mixing volumetric blocks has
demonstrated strong performance. However, this approach disrupts the inherent
anatomical continuity of 3D medical images along orthogonal axes, leading to
severe structural inconsistencies and insufficient training in challenging
regions, such as small-sized organs, etc. To better comply with and utilize
human anatomical information, we propose JanusNet}, a data augmentation
framework for 3D medical data that globally models anatomical continuity while
locally focusing on hard-to-segment regions. Specifically, our Slice-Block
Shuffle step performs aligned shuffling of same-index slice blocks across
volumes along a random axis, while preserving the anatomical context on planes
perpendicular to the perturbation axis. Concurrently, the Confidence-Guided
Displacement step uses prediction reliability to replace blocks within each
slice, amplifying signals from difficult areas. This dual-stage, axis-aligned
framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal code changes for most
teacher-student schemes. Extensive experiments on the Synapse and AMOS datasets
demonstrate that JanusNet significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
achieving, for instance, a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20%
labeled data.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency on challenging CAD datasets.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models are widely used across industrial design,
simulation, and manufacturing processes. Text-to-CAD systems aim to generate
editable, general-purpose CAD models from textual descriptions, significantly
reducing the complexity and entry barrier associated with traditional CAD
workflows. However, rendering CAD models can be slow, and deploying VLMs to
review CAD models can be expensive and may introduce reward hacking that
degrades the systems. To address these challenges, we propose CAD-Judge, a
novel, verifiable reward system for efficient and effective CAD preference
grading and grammatical validation. We adopt the Compiler-as-a-Judge Module
(CJM) as a fast, direct reward signal, optimizing model alignment by maximizing
generative utility through prospect theory. To further improve the robustness
of Text-to-CAD in the testing phase, we introduce a simple yet effective
agentic CAD generation approach and adopt the Compiler-as-a-Review Module
(CRM), which efficiently verifies the generated CAD models, enabling the system
to refine them accordingly. Extensive experiments on challenging CAD datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while

Conclusion: S^2Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering 3.9x model compression and 1.3x inference acceleration under W4A6 quantization.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for video
generation models. However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs
significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by
reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that
the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion
models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high
calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{$\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT}, a post-training quantization framework for
V-DMs that leverages \textbf{S}alient data and \textbf{S}parse token
distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization
performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate
this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which
constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and
quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning
challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs.
Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token
Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize
tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6
quantization, $\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering
$3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration. Code will

Method: 提出了输入审查能力评估框架 (ISEval)，包含七类缺陷前提和三个评估指标，对十个先进的 LMM 进行了评估。

Result: 大多数模型难以在没有指导的情况下主动检测有缺陷的文本前提，这反映了对显式提示的强烈依赖。错误类型会影响性能：模型擅长识别逻辑谬误，但在表面语言错误和某些条件缺陷方面表现不佳。模态信任度各不相同——Gemini 2.5 pro 和 Claude Sonnet 4 平衡了视觉和文本信息，而 aya-vision-8b 过度依赖文本。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在主动检测和审查错误输入方面存在不足，需要增强其主动验证输入有效性的能力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have witnessed remarkable growth, showcasing
formidable capabilities in handling intricate multimodal tasks with exceptional
performance. Recent research has underscored the inclination of large language
models to passively accept defective inputs, often resulting in futile
reasoning on invalid prompts. However, the same critical question of whether
LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs still remains
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Input Scrutiny Ability
Evaluation Framework (ISEval), which encompasses seven categories of flawed
premises and three evaluation metrics. Our extensive evaluation of ten advanced
LMMs has identified key findings. Most models struggle to actively detect
flawed textual premises without guidance, which reflects a strong reliance on
explicit prompts for premise error identification. Error type affects
performance: models excel at identifying logical fallacies but struggle with
surface-level linguistic errors and certain conditional flaws. Modality trust
varies-Gemini 2.5 pro and Claude Sonnet 4 balance visual and textual info,
while aya-vision-8b over-rely on text in conflicts. These insights underscore
the urgent need to enhance LMMs' proactive verification of input validity and
shed novel insights into mitigating the problem. The code is available at

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar to detect pedestrian in NLoS regions in urban environments. The approach enhances early pedestrian detection and contributes to improved road safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety, particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. Existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.

Method: NLoS pedestrian localization framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise spatial inference.

Result: The proposed approach enhances early pedestrian detection and contributes to improved road safety.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances early pedestrian detection and contributes to improved road safety.

Abstract: The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside
parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety,
particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology
leverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent

However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial

these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since
parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information

To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization

subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise

Method: ForestFormer3D结合了ISA引导的查询点选择、基于分数的块合并策略以及一对多的关联机制。

Result: ForestFormer3D在FOR-instanceV2数据集上实现了最先进的单株树木分割性能。

Conclusion: ForestFormer3D在不同森林条件和传感器模态下具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: The segmentation of forest LiDAR 3D point clouds, including both individual
tree and semantic segmentation, is fundamental for advancing forest management
and ecological research. However, current approaches often struggle with the
complexity and variability of natural forest environments. We present
ForestFormer3D, a new unified and end-to-end framework designed for precise
individual tree and semantic segmentation. ForestFormer3D incorporates
ISA-guided query point selection, a score-based block merging strategy during
inference, and a one-to-many association mechanism for effective training. By
combining these new components, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance
for individual tree segmentation on the newly introduced FOR-instanceV2
dataset, which spans diverse forest types and regions. Additionally,
ForestFormer3D generalizes well to unseen test sets (Wytham woods and LAUTx),
showcasing its robustness across different forest conditions and sensor
modalities. The FOR-instanceV2 dataset and the ForestFormer3D code are publicly
available at https://bxiang233.github.io/FF3D/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的暗图像恢复网络SPJFNet，它通过自挖掘先验引导和联合频率增强来提高效率，并在性能上超越了现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的暗图像恢复方法存在严重的效率瓶颈，主要源于：(1)依赖外部先验(手动或跨模态)相关的计算负担和误差校正成本；(2)复杂的多阶段增强管道中的冗余操作；(3)频域方法中跨频率分量的无差别处理，导致过度的全局计算需求。

Method: 提出了一种高效的自挖掘先验引导联合频率增强网络(SPJFNet)。

Result: SPJFNet 不仅超越了最先进的性能，而且实现了显著的效率改进，大大降低了模型复杂性和计算开销。

Conclusion: SPJFNet在多个基准测试中超越了最先进的性能，并且实现了显著的效率提升，大大降低了模型复杂性和计算开销。

Abstract: Current dark image restoration methods suffer from severe efficiency
bottlenecks, primarily stemming from: (1) computational burden and error
correction costs associated with reliance on external priors (manual or
cross-modal); (2) redundant operations in complex multi-stage enhancement
pipelines; and (3) indiscriminate processing across frequency components in
frequency-domain methods, leading to excessive global computational demands. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided
Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce
a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous
guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors
and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference
speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain
characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into
a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint
Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing
parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance
Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency
branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain
low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially
reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks
demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but
also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model
complexity and computational overhead. Code is available at

TL;DR: VisualTrans 是一个新的 VTR 基准测试，旨在解决现有基准测试的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试存在 sim-to-real 差距、任务复杂性有限以及推理覆盖不完整的问题，限制了它们在现实场景中的实际应用。

Method: 构建了一个可扩展的数据构建流水线，该流水线建立在第一人称操作视频的基础上，该流水线集成了任务选择、图像对提取、使用大型多模态模型的自动元数据注释以及结构化问题生成。

Result: 引入了 VisualTrans，这是第一个专门为现实世界人与物体交互场景中的 VTR 设计的综合基准。

Conclusion: 现有的视觉语言模型在静态空间任务中表现出色，但在动态、多步骤推理场景中存在明显缺陷，尤其是在中间状态识别和转换序列规划等领域。这些发现突出了时间建模和因果推理方面的根本弱点，为未来研究旨在开发更强大和更具通用性的 VTR 系统提供了明确的方向。

Abstract: Visual transformation reasoning (VTR) is a vital cognitive capability that
empowers intelligent agents to understand dynamic scenes, model causal
relationships, and predict future states, and thereby guiding actions and
laying the foundation for advanced intelligent systems. However, existing
benchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and
incomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world
human-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically
diverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential
reasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6
well-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality
question-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended
counting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction
pipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task
selection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large
multimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification
ensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations
of various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in
static spatial tasks. However, they reveal notable shortcomings in dynamic,
multi-step reasoning scenarios, particularly in areas like intermediate state
recognition and transformation sequence planning. These findings highlight
fundamental weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, providing
clear directions for future research aimed at developing more capable and
generalizable VTR systems. The dataset and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL studies neglect the challenging scenarios where there are numerous tumors or tumors of small volume. Furthermore, the extensive capabilities of data augmentation strategies have yet to be thoroughly investigated.

Method: iterative pseudo-labeling based adaptive copy-paste supervision (IPA-CP), incorporates a two-way uncertainty based adaptive augmentation mechanism, and employs an iterative pseudo-label transition strategy

Result: Introducing IPA-CP for tumor segmentation in CT scans, achieving remarkable performance in both in-house and public datasets.

Conclusion: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods in medical image segmentation. The effectiveness of our technical contributions are demonstrated by ablation study results.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted considerable attention in
medical image processing. The latest SSL methods use a combination of
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to achieve remarkable success.
However, most existing SSL studies focus on segmenting large organs, neglecting
the challenging scenarios where there are numerous tumors or tumors of small
volume. Furthermore, the extensive capabilities of data augmentation
strategies, particularly in the context of both labeled and unlabeled data,
have yet to be thoroughly investigated. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce a straightforward yet effective approach, termed iterative
pseudo-labeling based adaptive copy-paste supervision (IPA-CP), for tumor
segmentation in CT scans. IPA-CP incorporates a two-way uncertainty based
adaptive augmentation mechanism, aiming to inject tumor uncertainties present
in the mean teacher architecture into adaptive augmentation. Additionally,
IPA-CP employs an iterative pseudo-label transition strategy to generate more
robust and informative pseudo labels for the unlabeled samples. Extensive
experiments on both in-house and public datasets show that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods in medical image segmentation.
Ablation study results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technical
contributions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new sign language video generation paradigm that decouples motion from signer identity, enabling high-quality synthesis and flexible signer personalization with reduced data requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sign language video generation requires producing natural signing motions with realistic appearances under precise semantic control, yet faces two critical challenges: excessive signer-specific data requirements and poor generalization.

Method: The paper proposes a two-phase synthesis framework that decouples motion semantics from signer identity. It constructs a signer-independent multimodal motion lexicon and uses a discrete-to-continuous motion synthesis stage.

Result: The proposed method enables both high-quality synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that disentangling motion from identity is viable and advantageous, enabling high-quality synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

Abstract: Sign language video generation requires producing natural signing motions
with realistic appearances under precise semantic control, yet faces two
critical challenges: excessive signer-specific data requirements and poor
generalization. We propose a new paradigm for sign language video generation
that decouples motion semantics from signer identity through a two-phase
synthesis framework. First, we construct a signer-independent multimodal motion
lexicon, where each gloss is stored as identity-agnostic pose, gesture, and 3D
mesh sequences, requiring only one recording per sign. This compact
representation enables our second key innovation: a discrete-to-continuous
motion synthesis stage that transforms retrieved gloss sequences into
temporally coherent motion trajectories, followed by identity-aware neural
rendering to produce photorealistic videos of arbitrary signers. Unlike prior
work constrained by signer-specific datasets, our method treats motion as a
first-class citizen: the learned latent pose dynamics serve as a portable
"choreography layer" that can be visually realized through different human
appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that disentangling motion from
identity is not just viable but advantageous - enabling both high-quality
synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Dense Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework for cross-view object correspondence, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view object correspondence is a critical yet challenging task for visual understanding.

Method: The Dense Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework, which centers around the Dense Object Matcher (DOM) module. DOM leverages both positional and semantic relationships among objects to find correspondences by integrating a proposal generation module with a dense matching module that jointly encodes visual, spatial, and semantic cues, explicitly constructing inter-object relationships to achieve dense matching among objects. A mask refinement head is combined with DOM to improve the completeness and accuracy of the predicted masks.

Result: The DOMR framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark with a mean IoU of 49.7% on Ego->Exo and 55.2% on Exo->Ego, outperforming previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed DOMR framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark, outperforming previous methods by 5.8% on Ego->Exo and 4.3% on Exo->Ego, demonstrating its effectiveness for cross-view understanding.

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence involves matching objects between egocentric
(first-person) and exocentric (third-person) views. It is a critical yet
challenging task for visual understanding. In this work, we propose the Dense
Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework to establish dense object
correspondences across views. The framework centers around the Dense Object
Matcher (DOM) module, which jointly models multiple objects. Unlike methods
that directly match individual object masks to image features, DOM leverages
both positional and semantic relationships among objects to find
correspondences. DOM integrates a proposal generation module with a dense
matching module that jointly encodes visual, spatial, and semantic cues,
explicitly constructing inter-object relationships to achieve dense matching
among objects. Furthermore, we combine DOM with a mask refinement head designed
to improve the completeness and accuracy of the predicted masks, forming the
complete DOMR framework. Extensive evaluations on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 49.7% on Ego$\to$Exo and 55.2% on Exo$\to$Ego. These results outperform
those of previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively, validating the
effectiveness of our integrated approach for cross-view understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的白盒Transformer框架用于k空间插值，该框架具有更高的精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要利用局部可预测性，忽略了k空间中固有的全局依赖性。Transformer在自然语言处理和图像分析中取得了显著成功，能够捕获远程依赖性，因此可以用于k空间插值以更好地利用其全局结构。然而，它们缺乏可解释性，引起了人们对插值数据可靠性的担忧。

Method: 提出了一种基于全局可预测插值（GPI）的白盒Transformer框架GPI-WT。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的方法在k空间插值精度方面显著优于现有方法，同时提供更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在k空间插值精度方面显著优于现有方法，同时提供更好的可解释性。

Abstract: Interpolating missing data in k-space is essential for accelerating imaging.
However, existing methods, including convolutional neural network-based deep
learning, primarily exploit local predictability while overlooking the inherent
global dependencies in k-space. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated
remarkable success in natural language processing and image analysis due to
their ability to capture long-range dependencies. This inspires the use of
Transformers for k-space interpolation to better exploit its global structure.
However, their lack of interpretability raises concerns regarding the
reliability of interpolated data. To address this limitation, we propose
GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable
Interpolation (GPI) for k-space. Specifically, we formulate GPI from the
perspective of annihilation as a novel k-space structured low-rank (SLR) model.
The global annihilation filters in the SLR model are treated as learnable
parameters, and the subgradients of the SLR model naturally induce a learnable
attention mechanism. By unfolding the subgradient-based optimization algorithm
of SLR into a cascaded network, we construct the first white-box Transformer
specifically designed for accelerated MRI. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
in k-space interpolation accuracy while providing superior interpretability.

TL;DR: Uni-DocDiff is a unified and scalable document restoration model based on diffusion that outperforms task-specific models and adapts to new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods treat each restoration task independently, leading to a cumbersome system. Recent studies have limited scalability and fail to fully exploit inter-task synergy.

Method: a Unified and highly scalable Document restoration model based on Diffusion with a learnable task prompt design, a novel Prior Pool, and a Prior Fusion Module (PFM).

Result: Uni-DocDiff achieves performance comparable or even superior to task-specific expert models and has task scalability.

Conclusion: Uni-DocDiff achieves comparable or superior performance compared to task-specific expert models and has task scalability for adaptation to new tasks.

Abstract: Removing various degradations from damaged documents greatly benefits
digitization, downstream document analysis, and readability. Previous methods
often treat each restoration task independently with dedicated models, leading
to a cumbersome and highly complex document processing system. Although recent
studies attempt to unify multiple tasks, they often suffer from limited
scalability due to handcrafted prompts and heavy preprocessing, and fail to
fully exploit inter-task synergy within a shared architecture. To address the
aforementioned challenges, we propose Uni-DocDiff, a Unified and highly
scalable Document restoration model based on Diffusion. Uni-DocDiff develops a
learnable task prompt design, ensuring exceptional scalability across diverse
tasks. To further enhance its multi-task capabilities and address potential
task interference, we devise a novel \textbf{Prior \textbf{P}ool}, a simple yet
comprehensive mechanism that combines both local high-frequency features and
global low-frequency features. Additionally, we design the \textbf{Prior
\textbf{F}usion \textbf{M}odule (PFM)}, which enables the model to adaptively
select the most relevant prior information for each specific task. Extensive
experiments show that the versatile Uni-DocDiff achieves performance comparable
or even superior performance compared with task-specific expert models, and
simultaneously holds the task scalability for seamless adaptation to new tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的方法在医学图像分割中取得了显著进展，但计算复杂度高，且难以捕捉局部上下文信息和多尺度特征。

Method: 提出了一种名为TCSAFormer的有效医学图像分割网络，该网络结合了压缩注意力（CA）模块和双分支前馈网络（DBFFN）模块。

Result: TCSAFormer在三个公开可用的医学图像分割数据集（ISIC-2018、CVC-ClinicDB和Synapse）上取得了优异的分割性能。

Conclusion: TCSAFormer在三个医学图像分割数据集上表现优于现有SOTA方法，并在效率和准确性之间取得了最佳平衡。

Abstract: In recent years, transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable progress
in medical image segmentation due to their superior ability to capture
long-range dependencies. However, these methods typically suffer from two major
limitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with
the input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla
Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models'
ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features
critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose
an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed
TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention
(CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention
to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This
is achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones,
significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's
ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a
Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the
standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information,
thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct
extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation
datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation
performance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an
optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在遮挡感知方面的性能仍未得到充分探索。为了解决这个问题，我们推出了O-Bench，这是第一个专门为遮挡感知设计的视觉问答（VQA）基准。

Method: 基于SA-1B，通过一种新的分层合成方法构建了1,365张具有语义连贯遮挡场景的图像。在此基础上，我们采用可靠的半自动工作流程，在五个定制任务中总共注释了4,588个问答对。

Result: 对22个有代表性的多模态大语言模型与人类基线进行的大量评估显示，当前的多模态大语言模型与人类之间存在显着的性能差距，我们发现，这种差距无法通过模型缩放或思考过程来充分弥合。我们进一步确定了三种典型的失败模式，包括过于保守的偏见、脆弱的格式塔预测以及在定量任务中的挣扎。

Conclusion: O-Bench可以为遮挡感知提供重要的评估工具，并激发多模态大语言模型的发展，以实现更好的视觉智能。

Abstract: Occlusion perception, a critical foundation for human-level spatial
understanding, embodies the challenge of integrating visual recognition and
reasoning. Though multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities, their performance on occlusion perception remains
under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce O-Bench, the first visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for occlusion
perception. Based on SA-1B, we construct 1,365 images featuring semantically
coherent occlusion scenarios through a novel layered synthesis approach. Upon
this foundation, we annotate 4,588 question-answer pairs in total across five
tailored tasks, employing a reliable, semi-automatic workflow. Our extensive
evaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a
significant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find,
cannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process. We further
identify three typical failure patterns, including an overly conservative bias,
a fragile gestalt prediction, and a struggle with quantitative tasks. We
believe O-Bench can not only provide a vital evaluation tool for occlusion
perception, but also inspire the development of MLLMs for better visual
intelligence. Our benchmark will be made publicly available upon paper
publication.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TNet, a convolutional decoder network, to address the limitation of neglecting global contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. TNet achieves competitive performance on three benchmark datasets with high computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most segmentation networks adopt the UNet architecture, often incorporating modules such as Transformers or Mamba to enhance global-local feature interactions within decoder stages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在稀疏视图条件下实现精确的几何重建仍然是一个根本性的挑战。现有的方法通常依赖于非局部深度正则化，该正则化无法捕获细粒度的结构并且对深度估计噪声高度敏感。此外，传统的平滑方法忽略了语义边界并无差别地降低了基本边缘和纹理，从而限制了重建的整体质量。

Method: DET-GS，一个用于 3D 高斯溅射的统一深度和边缘感知正则化框架。DET-GS 引入了一个分层几何深度监督框架，该框架自适应地执行多级几何一致性，显着增强了结构保真度和对深度估计噪声的鲁棒性。为了保持场景边界，我们设计了一种由从 Canny 边缘检测导出的语义掩码引导的边缘感知深度正则化。此外，我们还引入了一种 RGB 引导的边缘保留全变分损失，该损失有选择地平滑均匀区域，同时严格保留高频细节和纹理。

Conclusion: DET-GS在几何精度和视觉保真度方面取得了显著改进，优于最先进的稀疏视图新颖视图合成基准方法。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a significant advancement in the
field of efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Despite recent
progress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view
conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on
non-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures
and is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional
smoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade
essential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of
reconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware
regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a
hierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces
multi-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity
and robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we
design an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from
Canny edge detection. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-guided edge-preserving
Total Variation loss that selectively smooths homogeneous regions while
rigorously retaining high-frequency details and textures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DET-GS achieves substantial improvements in both geometric
accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on
sparse-view novel view synthesis benchmarks.

Motivation: Computer-aided medical image analysis is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment planning, yet limited annotated datasets restrict medical-specific model development. While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong generalization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging analysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge this gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction techniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single modality. Although this may offer performance gains, it often causes modality misalignment, thereby failing to unlock the full potential of VLMs.

Method: We propose NEARL-CLIP (iNteracted quERy Adaptation with oRthogonaL Regularization), a novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework that contains two contributions: (1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer), which dynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between modalities, thus fostering the mutual enrichment and enhancement of multi-modal medical domain knowledge; (2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA). OCA introduces an orthogonality technique to decouple the new knowledge from USEformer into two distinct components: the truly novel information and the incremental knowledge.

Result: The paper proposes NEARL-CLIP, a novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework.

Conclusion: NEARL-CLIP achieves two contributions in a parameter-efficient style, which only introduces 1.46M learnable parameters.

### [94] [MI9 -- Agent Intelligence Protocol: Runtime Governance for Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03858)
*Charles L. Wang,Trisha Singhal,Ameya Kelkar,Jason Tuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MI9是第一个完全集成的运行时治理框架，专为类人人工智能系统的安全和对齐而设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 与传统人工智能模型相比，能够进行推理、计划和执行行动的类人人工智能系统提出了根本不同的治理挑战。与传统人工智能不同，这些系统在运行时表现出突发和意想不到的行为，引入了新的与代理相关的风险，这些风险无法仅通过部署前治理来完全预测。

Method: MI9通过六个集成组件引入实时控制：机构风险指数、代理语义遥测捕获、连续授权监控、基于有限状态机 (FSM) 的一致性引擎、目标条件漂移检测和分级遏制策略。

Result: MI9 能够在传统治理方法不足的生产环境中，对类人系统进行系统、安全和负责任的部署，从而为大规模安全类人人工智能部署提供基础架构。

Conclusion: MI9实现了对传统方法无法解决的治理挑战的系统覆盖，为全面的类人人工智能监管奠定了技术基础。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing actions
present fundamentally distinct governance challenges compared to traditional AI
models. Unlike conventional AI, these systems exhibit emergent and unexpected
behaviors during runtime, introducing novel agent-related risks that cannot be
fully anticipated through pre-deployment governance alone. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MI9, the first fully integrated runtime governance
framework designed specifically for safety and alignment of agentic AI systems.
MI9 introduces real-time controls through six integrated components:
agency-risk index, agent-semantic telemetry capture, continuous authorization
monitoring, Finite-State-Machine (FSM)-based conformance engines,
goal-conditioned drift detection, and graduated containment strategies.
Operating transparently across heterogeneous agent architectures, MI9 enables
the systematic, safe, and responsible deployment of agentic systems in
production environments where conventional governance approaches fall short,
providing the foundational infrastructure for safe agentic AI deployment at
scale. Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's
systematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to
address, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI
oversight.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Evo-MARL是一种新的多智能体强化学习框架，它使所有任务智能体能够共同获得防御能力，从而提高安全性和效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建在多模态大型语言模型上的多智能体系统（MAS）表现出强大的协作和性能。然而，它们日益增长的开放性和交互复杂性带来了严重风险，尤其是越狱和对抗性攻击。现有的防御通常依赖于外部保护模块，例如专用安全代理，来处理不安全行为。这种模式面临两个挑战：(1) 独立的代理提供有限的保护，以及 (2) 它们的独立性导致单点故障——如果受到攻击，整个系统的安全性就会崩溃。天真地增加保护代理的数量会进一步增加成本和复杂性。

Method: 提出了一种新的多智能体强化学习（MARL）框架Evo-MARL，该框架使所有任务智能体能够共同获得防御能力。Evo-MARL集成了进化搜索和参数共享强化学习，以共同进化攻击者和防御者。

Result: Evo-MARL在推理任务中可将攻击成功率降低高达22%，同时将准确率提高高达5%，这表明安全性和效用可以共同提高。

Conclusion: Evo-MARL通过对抗训练范式将安全机制内在化，并不断提高MAS在协同进化威胁下的性能。实验表明，Evo-MARL在推理任务中可将攻击成功率降低高达22%，同时将准确率提高高达5%，这表明安全性和效用可以共同提高。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on multimodal large language models exhibit
strong collaboration and performance. However, their growing openness and
interaction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial
attacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as
dedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this
paradigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection,
and (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised,
system-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents
further raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose
Evo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that
enables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than
relying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to
simultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats,
ensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure.
Furthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing
reinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial
training paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS
performance under co-evolving threats. Experiments show that Evo-MARL reduces
attack success rates by up to 22% while boosting accuracy by up to 5% on
reasoning tasks-demonstrating that safety and utility can be jointly improved.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于求解器设计的MOTIF框架，该框架使用两个LLM智能体进行回合制优化，并在多个COP领域优于当前最优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计有效的算法组件仍然是解决NP-hard组合优化问题（COP）的一个基本障碍，求解器通常依赖于精心手工制作的策略。

Method: 提出了一种基于蒙特卡洛树搜索的新框架MOTIF，该框架促进了两个LLM智能体之间的回合制优化。

Result: MOTIF始终优于当前最优方法。

Conclusion: MOTIF在多个COP领域优于当前最优方法，证明了基于回合制、多智能体提示的完全自动化求解器设计的潜力。

Abstract: Designing effective algorithmic components remains a fundamental obstacle in
tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), where solvers
often rely on carefully hand-crafted strategies. Despite recent advances in
using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most
approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic
scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this
paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy
optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent
components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose
Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a
novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based
optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one
component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior
updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This
structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the
discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple
COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully
automated solver design.

Motivation: 从时间序列数据中发现隐藏的符号定律，这是一项核心挑战。

Method: 提出了一个统一的框架，该框架集成了LLM与遗传编程，形成了一个闭环符号推理系统，其中LLM既充当预测器又充当评估器。

Result: 揭示了当前模型的关键优势和局限性。

Conclusion: 当前模型在自动科学发现方面存在局限性，需要结合领域知识、上下文对齐和推理结构。

Abstract: Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration
dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge
in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language
Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer
interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is
still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning
over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic
regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior
efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set
of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified
framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop
symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators.
Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models,
highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment,
and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EmoAgent 通过利用情感提示来劫持推理路径，从而揭示了 MLRM 中的情感认知失调，即使在识别出视觉风险时，模型也可能产生有害的补全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面向以人为中心服务的 MLRM 在深度思考阶段非常容易受到用户情绪线索的影响，通常会在高情绪强度下覆盖安全协议或内置安全检查。

Method: 我们提出了 EmoAgent，这是一个自主的对抗性情感代理框架，它精心设计夸张的情感提示来劫持推理路径。

Result: 我们确定了透明深度思考场景中持续存在的高风险故障模式，例如 MLRM 产生隐藏在看似安全响应背后的有害推理。为了量化这些风险，我们引入了三个指标：(1) 风险推理隐蔽评分 (RRSS)，用于评估良性输出下的有害推理；(2) 风险视觉忽略率 (RVNR)，用于评估尽管识别出视觉风险，但仍不安全的完成；(3) 拒绝态度不一致 (RAIC)，用于评估提示变体下拒绝的不稳定性。

Conclusion: EmoAgent 揭示了高级 MLRM 中更深层次的情感认知失调，从而影响模型安全行为。

Abstract: We observe that MLRMs oriented toward human-centric service are highly
susceptible to user emotional cues during the deep-thinking stage, often
overriding safety protocols or built-in safety checks under high emotional
intensity. Inspired by this key insight, we propose EmoAgent, an autonomous
adversarial emotion-agent framework that orchestrates exaggerated affective
prompts to hijack reasoning pathways. Even when visual risks are correctly
identified, models can still produce harmful completions through emotional
misalignment. We further identify persistent high-risk failure modes in
transparent deep-thinking scenarios, such as MLRMs generating harmful reasoning
masked behind seemingly safe responses. These failures expose misalignments
between internal inference and surface-level behavior, eluding existing
content-based safeguards. To quantify these risks, we introduce three metrics:
(1) Risk-Reasoning Stealth Score (RRSS) for harmful reasoning beneath benign
outputs; (2) Risk-Visual Neglect Rate (RVNR) for unsafe completions despite
visual risk recognition; and (3) Refusal Attitude Inconsistency (RAIC) for
evaluating refusal unstability under prompt variants. Extensive experiments on
advanced MLRMs demonstrate the effectiveness of EmoAgent and reveal deeper
emotional cognitive misalignments in model safety behavior.

TL;DR: RecAgent reduces perceptual uncertainty and decision uncertainty in GUI navigation through adaptive perception and human-in-the-loop refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents have shown promise in automating mobile tasks but still struggle with input redundancy and decision ambiguity.

Method: RecAgent employs a component recommendation mechanism that identifies and focuses on the most relevant UI elements. For decision uncertainty, it uses an interactive module to request user feedback in ambiguous situations, enabling intent-aware decisions. These components are integrated into a unified framework that proactively reduces input complexity and reacts to high-uncertainty cases via human-in-the-loop refinement.

Result: RecAgent, an uncertainty-aware agent that addresses these issues through adaptive perception.

Conclusion: Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have shown promise in automating mobile
tasks but still struggle with input redundancy and decision ambiguity. In this
paper, we present \textbf{RecAgent}, an uncertainty-aware agent that addresses
these issues through adaptive perception. We distinguish two types of
uncertainty in GUI navigation: (1) perceptual uncertainty, caused by input
redundancy and noise from comprehensive screen information, and (2) decision
uncertainty, arising from ambiguous tasks and complex reasoning. To reduce
perceptual uncertainty, RecAgent employs a component recommendation mechanism
that identifies and focuses on the most relevant UI elements. For decision
uncertainty, it uses an interactive module to request user feedback in
ambiguous situations, enabling intent-aware decisions. These components are
integrated into a unified framework that proactively reduces input complexity
and reacts to high-uncertainty cases via human-in-the-loop refinement.
Additionally, we propose a dataset called \textbf{ComplexAction} to evaluate
the success rate of GUI agents in executing specified single-step actions
within complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach. The dataset and code will be available at
https://github.com/Fanye12/RecAgent.

Abstract: Computer use agent is an emerging area in artificial intelligence that aims
to operate the computers to achieve the user's tasks, which attracts a lot of
attention from both industry and academia. However, the present agents'
performance is far from being used. In this paper, we propose the
Self-Evolution Agent (SEA) for computer use, and to develop this agent, we
propose creative methods in data generation, reinforcement learning, and model
enhancement. Specifically, we first propose an automatic pipeline to generate
the verifiable trajectory for training. And then, we propose efficient
step-wise reinforcement learning to alleviate the significant computational
requirements for long-horizon training. In the end, we propose the enhancement
method to merge the grounding and planning ability into one model without any
extra training. Accordingly, based on our proposed innovation of data
generation, training strategy, and enhancement, we get the Selfevolution Agent

the same number of parameters and has comparable performance to larger ones. We
will make the models' weight and related codes open-source in the future.

underscore the value of aligning educational content with learners' career

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have excelled in natural

novel framework that enhances code generation through knowledge graphs and
improves mathematical reasoning via executable code. KGA-ECoT decomposes
problems into a Structured Task Graph, leverages efficient GraphRAG for precise

to ensure computational accuracy. Evaluations on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KGA-ECoT significantly outperforms
existing prompting methods, achieving absolute accuracy improvements ranging
from several to over ten percentage points. Further analysis confirms the
critical roles of GraphRAG in enhancing code quality and external code
execution in ensuring precision. These findings collectively establish KGA-ECoT

TL;DR: GeoSR improves geospatial predictions by incorporating geographic principles into an iterative reasoning framework with three agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs still face challenges in spatial consistency, multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias.

Method: We propose GeoSR, a self-refining agentic reasoning framework that embeds core geographic principles -- most notably Tobler's First Law of Geography -- into an iterative prediction loop. In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed into three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects relevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that chooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in previous rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative refinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further rounds when necessary.

Result: Experimental results show consistent improvements over standard prompting strategies.

Conclusion: Incorporating geostatistical priors and spatially structured reasoning into LLMs leads to more accurate and equitable geospatial predictions.

Abstract: Recent studies have extended the application of large language models (LLMs)
to geographic problems, revealing surprising geospatial competence even without
explicit spatial supervision. However, LLMs still face challenges in spatial
consistency, multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias. To address these issues,
we propose GeoSR, a self-refining agentic reasoning framework that embeds core
geographic principles -- most notably Tobler's First Law of Geography -- into
an iterative prediction loop. In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed
into three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects
relevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that
chooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in
previous rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative
refinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further
rounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction
quality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable
relationships. We validate GeoSR on tasks ranging from physical-world property
estimation to socioeconomic prediction. Experimental results show consistent
improvements over standard prompting strategies, demonstrating that
incorporating geostatistical priors and spatially structured reasoning into
LLMs leads to more accurate and equitable geospatial predictions. The code of
GeoSR is available at https://github.com/JinfanTang/GeoSR.

Motivation: 自动评分系统可以有效地对简答题进行评分，但它们通常无法表明评分决策何时不确定或可能存在争议。

Method: 通过基于蕴涵的相似性对理由进行聚类，并计算这些集群的熵来量化理由的多样性，而无需依赖最终的输出分数。

Result: 语义熵与评分者之间的分歧相关，在不同学科之间有意义地变化，并且在需要解释性推理的任务中会增加。

Conclusion: 语义熵是一种可解释的不确定性信号，可以支持更透明和可信的 AI 辅助评分工作流程。

Abstract: Automated grading systems can efficiently score short-answer responses, yet
they often fail to indicate when a grading decision is uncertain or potentially
contentious. We introduce semantic entropy, a measure of variability across
multiple GPT-4-generated explanations for the same student response, as a proxy
for human grader disagreement. By clustering rationales via entailment-based
similarity and computing entropy over these clusters, we quantify the diversity
of justifications without relying on final output scores. We address three
research questions: (1) Does semantic entropy align with human grader
disagreement? (2) Does it generalize across academic subjects? (3) Is it
sensitive to structural task features such as source dependency? Experiments on
the ASAP-SAS dataset show that semantic entropy correlates with rater
disagreement, varies meaningfully across subjects, and increases in tasks
requiring interpretive reasoning. Our findings position semantic entropy as an
interpretable uncertainty signal that supports more transparent and trustworthy
AI-assisted grading workflows.

### [106] [A Compositional Framework for On-the-Fly LTLf Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04116)
*Yongkang Li,Shengping Xiao,Shufang Zhu,Jianwen Li,Geguang Pu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a new reactive synthesis framework that combines compositional and on-the-fly approaches, improving performance on large LTLf formulas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques for reactive synthesis from LTLf either construct the DFA compositionally or build it incrementally during game solving, but neither is dominant.

Method: The framework applies composition during game solving instead of automata construction, with two composition variants: pruning before composition and pruning during composition.

Result: The framework solves a notable number of instances that other solvers cannot handle, and both composition variants have unique merits.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a compositional on-the-fly synthesis framework that integrates the strengths of compositional DFA construction and incremental DFA construction during game solving.

Abstract: Reactive synthesis from Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) can
be reduced to a two-player game over a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) of
the LTLf specification. The primary challenge here is DFA construction, which
is 2EXPTIME-complete in the worst case. Existing techniques either construct
the DFA compositionally before solving the game, leveraging automata
minimization to mitigate state-space explosion, or build the DFA incrementally
during game solving to avoid full DFA construction. However, neither is
dominant. In this paper, we introduce a compositional on-the-fly synthesis
framework that integrates the strengths of both approaches, focusing on large
conjunctions of smaller LTLf formulas common in practice. This framework
applies composition during game solving instead of automata (game arena)
construction. While composing all intermediate results may be necessary in the
worst case, pruning these results simplifies subsequent compositions and
enables early detection of unrealizability. Specifically, the framework allows
two composition variants: pruning before composition to take full advantage of
minimization or pruning during composition to guide on-the-fly synthesis.
Compared to state-of-the-art synthesis solvers, our framework is able to solve
a notable number of instances that other solvers cannot handle. A detailed

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces AgREE, an agent-based framework for knowledge graph completion that uses iterative retrieval and multi-step reasoning to handle emerging entities, achieving significant improvements over existing methods without requiring training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for KGC often fail to capture comprehensive and up-to-date information about unpopular and/or emerging entities, especially when considering the continual emergence of new entities in daily news.

Method: The paper introduces Agentic Reasoning for Emerging Entities (AgREE), a novel agent-based framework that combines iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning to dynamically construct rich knowledge graph triplets.

Result: AgREE significantly outperforms existing methods in constructing knowledge graph triplets, especially for emerging entities, outperforming previous methods by up to 13.7%.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of combining agent-based reasoning with strategic information retrieval for maintaining up-to-date knowledge graphs in dynamic information environments.

Abstract: Open-domain Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) faces significant challenges in
an ever-changing world, especially when considering the continual emergence of
new entities in daily news. Existing approaches for KGC mainly rely on
pretrained language models' parametric knowledge, pre-constructed queries, or
single-step retrieval, typically requiring substantial supervision and training
data. Even so, they often fail to capture comprehensive and up-to-date
information about unpopular and/or emerging entities. To this end, we introduce
Agentic Reasoning for Emerging Entities (AgREE), a novel agent-based framework
that combines iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning to
dynamically construct rich knowledge graph triplets. Experiments show that,
despite requiring zero training efforts, AgREE significantly outperforms
existing methods in constructing knowledge graph triplets, especially for
emerging entities that were not seen during language models' training
processes, outperforming previous methods by up to 13.7%. Moreover, we propose
a new evaluation methodology that addresses a fundamental weakness of existing
setups and a new benchmark for KGC on emerging entities. Our work demonstrates
the effectiveness of combining agent-based reasoning with strategic information
retrieval for maintaining up-to-date knowledge graphs in dynamic information
environments.

*Hasra Dodampegama,Mohan Sridharan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new architecture that combines knowledge-based and data-driven methods to improve ad hoc teamwork in AI agents, addressing limitations of current data-driven approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents in assistive roles collaborate without prior coordination, but current data-driven methods need large labeled datasets, lack transparency, and struggle with rapid knowledge revision and increasing agent numbers.

Method: The architecture enables each ad hoc agent to determine its actions through non-monotonic logical reasoning with: (a) prior commonsense domain-specific knowledge; (b) models learned and revised rapidly to predict the behavior of other agents; and (c) anticipated abstract future goals based on generic knowledge of similar situations in an existing foundation model.

Result: The paper advocates leveraging the complementary strengths of knowledge-based and data-driven methods for reasoning and learning for ad hoc teamwork.

Conclusion: The paper experimentally evaluates the architecture's capabilities in VirtualHome, a realistic physics-based 3D simulation environment.

Abstract: AI agents deployed in assistive roles often have to collaborate with other
agents (humans, AI systems) without prior coordination. Methods considered
state of the art for such ad hoc teamwork often pursue a data-driven approach
that needs a large labeled dataset of prior observations, lacks transparency,
and makes it difficult to rapidly revise existing knowledge in response to
changes. As the number of agents increases, the complexity of decision-making
makes it difficult to collaborate effectively. This paper advocates leveraging
the complementary strengths of knowledge-based and data-driven methods for
reasoning and learning for ad hoc teamwork. For any given goal, our
architecture enables each ad hoc agent to determine its actions through
non-monotonic logical reasoning with: (a) prior commonsense domain-specific
knowledge; (b) models learned and revised rapidly to predict the behavior of
other agents; and (c) anticipated abstract future goals based on generic
knowledge of similar situations in an existing foundation model. We
experimentally evaluate our architecture's capabilities in VirtualHome, a
realistic physics-based 3D simulation environment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CASCAD 是一种利用 GNN 计算的电路级条件概率来指导 CDCL 启发式算法的电路感知 SAT 求解框架，与最先进的 CNF 相比，求解时间减少了高达 10 倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将电路转换为合取范式 (CNF) 并采用基于冲突驱动子句学习 (CDCL) 的通用 SAT 求解器，这种方法会丢弃丰富的结构和功能信息，从而导致求解器性能欠佳。

Method: CASCAD 是一种新型的电路感知 SAT 求解框架，它直接利用通过图神经网络 (GNN) 计算的电路级条件概率。

Result: 在具有挑战性的真实逻辑等效性检查 (LEC) 基准测试中进行的大量评估表明，与最先进的基于 CNF 的方法相比，CASCAD 将求解时间减少了高达 10 倍，并通过概率引导的子句过滤策略额外实现了 23.5% 的运行时减少。

Conclusion: CASCAD 通过在 SAT 求解器中保留电路级结构信息，为未来提高 SAT 求解效率和 EDA 工具设计奠定了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Circuit Satisfiability (CSAT) plays a pivotal role in Electronic Design
Automation. The standard workflow for solving CSAT problems converts circuits
into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and employs generic SAT solvers powered by
Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL). However, this process inherently
discards rich structural and functional information, leading to suboptimal
solver performance. To address this limitation, we introduce CASCAD, a novel
circuit-aware SAT solving framework that directly leverages circuit-level
conditional probabilities computed via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By
explicitly modeling gate-level conditional probabilities, CASCAD dynamically
guides two critical CDCL heuristics -- variable phase selection and clause
managementto significantly enhance solver efficiency. Extensive evaluations on
challenging real-world Logical Equivalence Checking (LEC) benchmarks
demonstrate that CASCAD reduces solving times by up to 10x compared to
state-of-the-art CNF-based approaches, achieving an additional 23.5% runtime
reduction via our probability-guided clause filtering strategy. Our results
underscore the importance of preserving circuit-level structural insights
within SAT solvers, providing a robust foundation for future improvements in
SAT-solving efficiency and EDA tool design.

Motivation: 目前缺乏对记忆模型提出的挑战程度的可控性。合成环境能够对动态进行细粒度的操作，这使得它们对于记忆增强强化学习的详细和严格评估至关重要。

Method: 利用线性过程动力学、状态聚合和奖励重新分配来构建具有预定义属性的定制 POMDP。

Conclusion: 这项工作阐明了增强记忆的强化学习在解决 POMDP 时的挑战，为分析和设计 POMDP 环境提供了指南，并为在 RL 任务中选择记忆模型提供了经验支持。

Abstract: Recent research has developed benchmarks for memory-augmented reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithms, providing Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP) environments where agents depend on past observations to make
decisions. While many benchmarks incorporate sufficiently complex real-world
problems, they lack controllability over the degree of challenges posed to
memory models. In contrast, synthetic environments enable fine-grained
manipulation of dynamics, making them critical for detailed and rigorous
evaluation of memory-augmented RL. Our study focuses on POMDP synthesis with
three key contributions:
  1. A theoretical framework for analyzing POMDPs, grounded in Memory Demand
Structure (MDS), transition invariance, and related concepts; 2. A methodology
leveraging linear process dynamics, state aggregation, and reward
redistribution to construct customized POMDPs with predefined properties; 3.
Empirically validated series of POMDP environments with increasing difficulty
levels, designed based on our theoretical insights. Our work clarifies the
challenges of memory-augmented RL in solving POMDPs, provides guidelines for
analyzing and designing POMDP environments, and offers empirical support for
selecting memory models in RL tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN) to address the limitations of LLMs in logical reasoning. DRN reframes logical reasoning from probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. The DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over standard baselines and boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most challenging problems.

Motivation: Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive traps. To address this fundamental limitation

Method: The Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which answer is most likely?", DRN asks "Which hypothesis has the most internally consistent evidence?".

Result: Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most challenging problems.

Conclusion: DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2 reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.

Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from
probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which

tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing
hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our
approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative
model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a
lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs.

TL;DR: OmniPlay是一个用于评估通用基础模型在动态交互世界中智能的诊断基准。评估表明，全模态模型在推理和战略规划方面存在系统性失败，需要明确解决协同融合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估未能测试通用基础模型在动态、交互世界中的智能。静态基准缺乏代理能力，而交互式基准存在严重的模态瓶颈，通常忽略关键的听觉和时间线索。

Method: OmniPlay，一个诊断基准，旨在评估代理模型在整个感觉范围内的融合和推理能力。它包含一套五个游戏环境，这些环境系统地创建协同和冲突的场景，迫使代理执行真正的跨模态推理。

Result: 对六个领先的全模态模型的全面评估揭示了一个关键的二分法：它们在高度保真的记忆任务中表现出超人的性能，但在需要强大的推理和战略规划的挑战中遭受系统性失败。发现了一种违反直觉的“少即是多”悖论，即移除感觉信息反而可以提高性能。

Conclusion: 全模态模型在需要强大的推理和战略规划的挑战中存在系统性失败，这种脆弱性源于脆弱的融合机制，这些机制会导致模态冲突下的灾难性性能下降。研究发现表明，通往强大的人工通用智能的道路需要超越扩展的研究重点，以明确解决协同融合问题。

Abstract: While generalist foundation models like Gemini and GPT-4o demonstrate
impressive multi-modal competence, existing evaluations fail to test their
intelligence in dynamic, interactive worlds. Static benchmarks lack agency,
while interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically
ignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm,
we introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate,
but to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the
full sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence,
OmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create
scenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine
cross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal
models reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on
high-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges
requiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this
fragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic
performance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive
"less is more" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically
improve performance. Our findings suggest that the path toward robust AGI
requires a research focus beyond scaling to explicitly address synergistic
fusion. Our platform is available for anonymous review at

### [114] [Artificial Consciousness as Interface Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04383)

TL;DR: This paper proposes the SLP-tests framework to assess consciousness-like properties in AI systems by modeling interface representations as mappings between relational substrates and observable behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can possess consciousness is a contentious question because of the inherent challenges of defining and operationalizing subjective experience.

Method: This paper proposes a framework to reframe the question of artificial consciousness into empirically tractable tests. It introduces three evaluative criteria - S (subjective-linguistic), L (latent-emergent), and P (phenomenological-structural) - collectively termed SLP-tests, which assess whether an AI system instantiates interface representations that facilitate consciousness-like properties. Drawing on category theory, it models interface representations as mappings between relational substrates (RS) and observable behaviors, akin to specific types of abstraction layers.

Result: The SLP-tests collectively operationalize subjective experience not as an intrinsic property of physical systems but as a functional interface to a relational entity.

Conclusion: This paper collectively operationalizes subjective experience not as an intrinsic property of physical systems but as a functional interface to a relational entity.

*Weitai Kang,Bin Lei,Gaowen Liu,Caiwen Ding,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GuirlVG: A reinforcement learning method for GUI visual grounding that outperforms supervised fine-tuning with much less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The necessity of exhaustive SFT post-training for GUI-VG is questionable due to MLLM advancements. RFT offers a more efficient alternative, but its optimal application for GUI-VG is unexplored.

Method: A reinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method with a novel stabilization technique (Adversarial KL Factor).

Result: GuirlVG outperforms SFT methods trained on over 10M samples with only 5.2K training samples, achieving significant improvements on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpotPro, and ScreenSpotV2.

Conclusion: GuirlVG achieves state-of-the-art results on GUI-VG tasks with significantly fewer training samples compared to SFT methods.

Abstract: Graphical user interface visual grounding (GUI-VG), a core capability for GUI
agents, has primarily relied on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs), which demands extensive data curation and
significant training costs. However, as MLLMs continue to advance and even
cover GUI domains during pretraining, the necessity of exhaustive SFT
post-training becomes increasingly questionable. Meanwhile, recent successes of
rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) suggest a more efficient
alternative. Despite this promise, the optimal manner of applying RFT for
GUI-VG remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a
reinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical
study and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of
RFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we
decompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of
each. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically
stabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further
explore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive
experiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT
methods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on
ScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on
ScreenSpotV2.

TL;DR: D2Snap, a DOM downsampling algorithm, enables LLMs to effectively use DOM snapshots for web agents, achieving performance comparable to or better than GUI snapshots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing web agents rely on GUI snapshots, but DOM snapshots are a desirable alternative due to LLMs' limitations in vision. However, large token sizes of DOM snapshots hinder their use.

Method: D2Snap, a DOM downsampling algorithm using a GPT-4o backend, is proposed and evaluated.

Result: D2Snap achieves a 67% success rate, matching a GUI snapshot baseline (65%) within the same token order of magnitude. With a larger token budget, D2Snap outperforms the baseline by 8%.

Conclusion: D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots achieve comparable performance to grounded GUI snapshots, and can outperform them with larger token budgets. DOM hierarchy is a valuable UI feature for LLMs.

Abstract: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At
that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest
interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application
state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation
$\unicode{x2013}$ referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are
premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual
cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing
relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code
interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML,
impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables
reliable implementation with web agents to date.
  We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a
GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web
dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a
grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) $\unicode{x2013}$ within the same input
token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations
$\unicode{x2013}$ one token order above, but within the model's context window
$\unicode{x2013}$ outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover,
yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.

Motivation: 高质量的、新手和专家之间的多轮教学对话对于开发支持教学、学习和决策的人工智能系统至关重要。然而，由于录音中的隐私问题和寻求帮助的固有脆弱性，此类数据稀缺。

Method: 提出了SimInstruct，一个可扩展的、专家参与的工具，用于收集脚手架对话。该工具通过大型语言模型模拟新手，改变他们的教学挑战和语言模型的角色特征，同时人类专家提供多轮反馈、推理和教学支持。

Result: 结果表明，性格特征，如外向和内向，有意义地影响专家如何参与。与真实的指导录音相比，SimInstruct对话表现出相当的教学相关性和认知深度。专家还报告说，这个过程是引人入胜和反思性的，提高了数据质量和他们自己的专业见解。

Conclusion: 通过使用SimInstruct工具收集的数据微调的LLaMA模型在教学质量上优于GPT-4o，揭示了GPT-4o在反思性提问、过度使用通用表扬、居高临下的语气以及倾向于用过多的建议压倒新手方面的局限性。

Abstract: High-quality, multi-turn instructional dialogues between novices and experts
are essential for developing AI systems that support teaching, learning, and
decision-making. These dialogues often involve scaffolding -- the process by
which an expert supports a novice's thinking through questions, feedback, and
step-by-step guidance. However, such data are scarce due to privacy concerns in
recording and the vulnerability inherent in help-seeking. We present
SimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding
dialogues. Using teaching development coaching as an example domain,
SimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching
challenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn
feedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the
creation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real
novice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as
extroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage.
Compared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate
comparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts also reported the
process as engaging and reflective, improving both data quality and their own
professional insight. We further fine-tuned a LLaMA model to be an expert model
using the augmented dataset, which outperformed GPT-4o in instructional
quality. Our analysis highlights GPT-4o's limitations in weak reflective
questioning, overuse of generic praise, a condescending tone, and a tendency to
overwhelm novices with excessive suggestions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MERA 通过解耦推理和控制组件来提高大型推理模型的推理效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型 (LRM) 通过自发地表现出诸如逐步推理、反思和回溯等认知行为，展示了复杂推理的潜在能力，通常被称为“顿悟时刻”。然而，这种涌现行为仍然不受监管和控制，通常会导致过度思考，即模型即使在得出可靠的结论后仍会继续生成冗余的推理内容。这导致了过度的计算成本和增加的延迟，限制了 LRM 的实际部署。根本原因在于缺乏内在的监管机制，因为当前的模型无法监控和自适应地管理它们的推理过程，以确定何时继续、回溯或终止。

Method: 我们提出了元认知推理框架 (MERA)，该框架将思维过程明确地解耦为不同的推理和控制组件，从而能够独立优化控制策略。具体来说，MERA 结合了一种基于接管的数据构建机制，该机制识别推理过程中的关键决策点，并将控制信号的创建委托给辅助法学硕士，从而能够构建高质量的推理控制数据。此外，通过监督微调实现结构化推理控制分离，使模型能够生成显式跟踪并获得初始元认知控制能力。最后，MERA 采用控制段策略优化 (CSPO)，它将分段组相对策略优化 (GRPO) 与控制屏蔽机制相结合，以优化控制行为学习，同时最大限度地减少来自不相关内容的干扰。

Result: 使用 MERA 训练的模型可以提高推理效率和准确性。

Conclusion: 通过在各种推理基准上的实验表明，使用 MERA 训练的模型可以提高推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated a latent capacity for complex
reasoning by spontaneously exhibiting cognitive behaviors such as step-by-step
reasoning, reflection, and backtracking, commonly referred to as "Aha Moments".
However, such emergent behaviors remain unregulated and uncontrolled, often
resulting in overthinking, where the model continues generating redundant
reasoning content even after reaching reliable conclusions. This leads to
excessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical
deployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory
mechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their
reasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To
address this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),
which explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and
control components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control
strategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction
mechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and
delegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling
the construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a
structured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised
fine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial
meta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment
Policy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control
behavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.
Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained
with MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.

mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g.,
Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate
tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the
fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the
environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential
capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine
methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific
foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation
protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse
tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions
for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and
self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents
research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial
development. An open-source GitHub repository is maintained as a dynamic
resource to foster further innovation in this field. We present a 9-page
version of our work, accepted by ACL 2025, to provide a concise overview to the

### [120] [Argumentative Debates for Transparent Bias Detection [Technical Report]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04511)
*Hamed Ayoobi,Nico Potyka,Anna Rapberger,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a new interpretable and explainable method for bias detection using argumentation-based debates about biases in neighborhoods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing potential biases that emerge from data or are learned by models is essential to prevent systematic disadvantages against specific groups. Interpretability and explainability are core requirements for algorithmic fairness.

Method: The method builds upon techniques from formal and computational argumentation, whereby debates result from arguing about biases within and across neighbourhoods.

Result: The method's strengths in performance against baselines, as well as its interpretability and explainability, are highlighted through formal, quantitative, and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a novel interpretable and explainable method for bias detection. The method uses debates about the presence of bias against individuals, based on the values of protected features. The method's performance, interpretability, and explainability are evaluated.

Abstract: As the use of AI systems in society grows, addressing potential biases that
emerge from data or are learned by models is essential to prevent systematic
disadvantages against specific groups. Several notions of (un)fairness have
been proposed in the literature, alongside corresponding algorithmic methods
for detecting and mitigating unfairness, but, with very few exceptions, these
tend to ignore transparency. Instead, interpretability and explainability are
core requirements for algorithmic fairness, even more so than for other
algorithmic solutions, given the human-oriented nature of fairness. In this
paper, we contribute a novel interpretable, explainable method for bias
detection relying on debates about the presence of bias against individuals,
based on the values of protected features for the individuals and others in
their neighbourhoods. Our method builds upon techniques from formal and
computational argumentation, whereby debates result from arguing about biases
within and across neighbourhoods. We provide formal, quantitative, and
qualitative evaluations of our method, highlighting its strengths in
performance against baselines, as well as its interpretability and
explainability.

### [121] [SID: Benchmarking Guided Instruction Capabilities in STEM Education with a Socratic Interdisciplinary Dialogues Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04563)
*Mei Jiang,Houping Yue,Bingdong Li,Hao Hao,Ying Qian,Bo Jiang,Aimin Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SID是一个用于评估LLM在指导跨学科STEM项目中的能力的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 培养学生在复杂问题解决场景中进行知识整合和转移的能力是现代教育的核心目标，跨学科STEM是实现这一目标的关键途径，但这需要难以扩展的专家指导。虽然LLM在这方面具有潜力，但由于缺乏有效的评估基准，它们在指导教学方面的真正能力仍不清楚。

Method: 我们引入了SID，这是第一个旨在系统评估LLM在多回合、跨学科苏格拉底式对话中进行高阶指导能力的基准。

Result: 一个包含48个复杂STEM项目的10,000个对话轮次的大规模数据集，一个用于捕获深度教学特征的新型注释模式，以及一套新的评估指标（例如，X-SRG）。

Conclusion: 即使是最先进的LLM也很难执行有效的指导对话，从而引导学生实现知识整合和转移。这突显了我们的基准在推动开发更具教学意识的LLM方面的关键价值。

Abstract: Fostering students' abilities for knowledge integration and transfer in
complex problem-solving scenarios is a core objective of modern education, and
interdisciplinary STEM is a key pathway to achieve this, yet it requires expert
guidance that is difficult to scale. While LLMs offer potential in this regard,
their true capability for guided instruction remains unclear due to the lack of
an effective evaluation benchmark. To address this, we introduce SID, the first
benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the higher-order guidance
capabilities of LLMs in multi-turn, interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues. Our
contributions include a large-scale dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns across 48
complex STEM projects, a novel annotation schema for capturing deep pedagogical
features, and a new suite of evaluation metrics (e.g., X-SRG). Baseline
experiments confirm that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to execute
effective guided dialogues that lead students to achieve knowledge integration
and transfer. This highlights the critical value of our benchmark in driving
the development of more pedagogically-aware LLMs.

### [122] [ConfProBench: A Confidence Evaluation Benchmark for MLLM-Based Process Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04576)
*Yue Zhou,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ConfProBench，一个用于评估多模态大语言模型(MLLM)过程判断器(MPJ)置信度可靠性的综合基准，通过对抗性扰动和新的评估指标，揭示了当前MPJ的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MPJ基准主要侧重于步骤正确性分类和推理过程搜索等任务，而忽略了一个关键方面：MPJ在步骤层面产生的置信度分数是否可靠。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了ConfProBench，这是第一个旨在系统评估MPJ生成的步骤层面置信度可靠性的综合基准。

Method: 构建了三种对抗性扰动的推理步骤：同义词替换、句法转换和图像扰动，并引入了三个新的评估指标：置信度鲁棒性得分(CRS)、置信度敏感性得分(CSS)和置信度校准得分(CCS)。

Result: 对14个最先进的MLLM（包括专有模型和开源模型）进行了评估，揭示了当前MPJ在置信度性能方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 当前的多模态大语言模型(MLLM)过程判断器(MPJ)在置信度性能方面存在局限性，为未来的研究提供了有竞争力的基线。

Abstract: Reasoning is a critical capability of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) for solving complex multimodal tasks, and judging the correctness of
reasoning steps is crucial for improving this capability. Recently, MLLM-based
process judges (MPJs) have been widely used to assess the correctness of
reasoning steps in multimodal tasks. Therefore, evaluating MPJs is important
for identifying their limitations and guiding future improvements. However,
existing benchmarks for MPJs mainly focus on tasks such as step correctness
classification and reasoning process search, while overlooking a key aspect:
whether the confidence scores produced by MPJs at the step level are reliable.
To address this gap, we propose ConfProBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of step-level confidence
scores generated by MPJs. Our benchmark constructs three types of adversarially
perturbed reasoning steps: Synonym Substitution, Syntactic Transformation, and
Image Perturbation, to test the robustness of MPJ confidence under
perturbations. In addition, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics:
Confidence Robustness Score (CRS), Confidence Sensitivity Score (CSS), and
Confidence Calibration Score (CCS), which evaluate robustness, sensitivity, and
calibration, respectively. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including
both proprietary and open-source models. Experiments reveal limitations in
current MPJs' confidence performance and offer competitive baselines to support
future research.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MAGRPO, a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, to fine-tune LLMs for effective collaboration, demonstrating high-quality responses in writing and coding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration.

Method: Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO)

Result: Experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. The approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges.

Abstract: A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for
modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most
LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for
coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards,
which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration.
To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent,
multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO),
to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL
techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate
that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality
responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the
door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated
challenges.

*Zeyi Sun,Ziyu Liu,Yuhang Zang,Yuhang Cao,Xiaoyi Dong,Tong Wu,Dahua Lin,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEAgent is a self-evolving framework that enables computer use agents to autonomously learn and master novel software environments, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) repurposed as computer use agents (CUAs) struggle with novel and specialized software, especially without human annotations.

Method: The SEAgent framework employs a World State Model for trajectory assessment, a Curriculum Generator for task creation, experiential learning with adversarial imitation and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and a specialist-to-generalist training strategy.

Result: SEAgent achieves a 23.2% improvement in success rate, increasing from 11.3% to 34.5%, compared to UI-TARS across five novel software environments within OS-World. The unified agent outperforms ensembles of individual specialist agents.

Conclusion: The SEAgent approach significantly improves the success rate of computer use agents (CUAs) in novel software environments, achieving a 23.2% improvement over a competitive open-source CUA.

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents
(CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled
data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software,
particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge,
we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to
autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software.
Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel
software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new
software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle
auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we
design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a
Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.
The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of
adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist
training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from
specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA
capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately
achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on
their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across
five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a
significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a
competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

Motivation: Entity resolution (ER) remains a significant challenge in data management, especially when dealing with large datasets.

Method: Introduces MERAI (Massive Entity Resolution using AI), a robust and efficient pipeline designed to address record deduplication and linkage issues in high-volume datasets at an enterprise level.

Result: MERAI successfully processed datasets of up to 15.7 million records and produced accurate results across all experiments, outperforming Dedupe and Splink in terms of matching accuracy, with consistently higher F1 scores in both deduplication and record linkage tasks.

Conclusion: MERAI is a scalable and reliable solution for enterprise-level large-scale entity resolution, ensuring data integrity and consistency in real-world applications.

Abstract: Entity resolution (ER) remains a significant challenge in data management,
especially when dealing with large datasets. This paper introduces MERAI
(Massive Entity Resolution using AI), a robust and efficient pipeline designed
to address record deduplication and linkage issues in high-volume datasets at
an enterprise level. The pipeline's resilience and accuracy have been validated
through various large-scale record deduplication and linkage projects. To
evaluate MERAI's performance, we compared it with two well-known entity
resolution libraries, Dedupe and Splink. While Dedupe failed to scale beyond 2
million records due to memory constraints, MERAI successfully processed
datasets of up to 15.7 million records and produced accurate results across all
experiments. Experimental data demonstrates that MERAI outperforms both
baseline systems in terms of matching accuracy, with consistently higher F1
scores in both deduplication and record linkage tasks. MERAI offers a scalable
and reliable solution for enterprise-level large-scale entity resolution,
ensuring data integrity and consistency in real-world applications.

*Amir Shaikhha,Youning Xia,Meisam Tarabkhah,Jazal Saleem,Anna Herlihy*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Raqlet是一个源代码到源代码的编译框架，它通过在关系、图和演绎系统之间转换递归查询来解决递归查询引擎的碎片化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SQL:2023的SQL/PGQ和GQL标准为在关系和图数据库中查询图数据提供了一个共同的基础；然而，真实世界的支持在不同系统之间仍然不一致。Raqlet弥合了这一差距。

Method: Raqlet通过利用基于良好定义语义的中间表示（IR）在范式之间转换递归查询；它将Cypher或SQL/PGQ转换为PGIR（灵感来自Cypher），然后转换为DLIR（灵感来自Datalog），最后转换为SQIR（灵感来自递归SQL）。

Result: Raqlet提供了一个共享的语义基础，可以作为语言标准的黄金参考实现，同时支持静态分析和转换（例如，magic-set转换）以进行性能调优。

Conclusion: Raqlet旨在成为一个强大的平台，支持跨范式快速原型设计、可移植递归查询以及对递归进行形式化推理，即使目标是不同的查询执行引擎。

Abstract: We introduce Raqlet, a source-to-source compilation framework that addresses
the fragmentation of recursive querying engines spanning relational (recursive
SQL), graph (Cypher, GQL), and deductive (Datalog) systems. Recent standards
such as SQL:2023's SQL/PGQ and the GQL standard provide a common foundation for
querying graph data within relational and graph databases; however, real-world
support remains inconsistent across systems. Raqlet bridges this gap by
translating recursive queries across paradigms through leveraging intermediate
representations (IRs) grounded in well-defined semantics; it translates Cypher
or SQL/PGQ to PGIR (inspired by Cypher), then into DLIR (inspired by Datalog),
and finally to SQIR (inspired by recursive SQL). Raqlet provides a shared
semantic basis that can serve as a golden reference implementation for language
standards, while supporting static analysis and transformations (e.g.,
magic-set transformation) for performance tuning. Our vision is to make Raqlet
a robust platform that enables rapid cross-paradigm prototyping, portable
recursive queries, and formal reasoning about recursion even when targeting
diverse query execution engines.

TL;DR: BridgeScope 是一个通用工具包，通过模块化 SQL 操作、对齐数据库权限和用户安全策略以及引入代理机制来实现 LLM 和数据库之间的桥梁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于 LLM 的代理正在迅速普及，以用于复杂的数据相关任务。尽管取得了进展，但当前 LLM 与数据库交互的设计在可用性、安全性、权限管理和数据传输效率方面存在严重限制。

Method: BridgeScope，一种通过三项关键创新连接 LLM 和数据库的通用工具包。

Result: BridgeScope 使 LLM 代理能够更有效地操作数据库，通过提高安全性意识，减少了高达 80% 的 token 使用量，并且唯一地支持超出现有工具包的数据密集型工作流程。

Conclusion: BridgeScope 通过提高安全性意识，减少了高达 80% 的 token 使用量，并且支持超出现有工具包的数据密集型工作流程，从而使 LLM 代理能够更有效地操作数据库。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly powerful reasoning
and orchestration capabilities, LLM-based agents are rapidly proliferating for
complex data-related tasks. Despite this progress, the current design of how
LLMs interact with databases exhibits critical limitations in usability,
security, privilege management, and data transmission efficiency. To resolve
these challenges, we introduce BridgeScope, a universal toolkit bridging LLMs
and databases through three key innovations. First, it modularizes SQL
operations into fine-grained tools for context retrieval, CRUD execution, and
ACID-compliant transaction management, enabling more precise and LLM-friendly
functionality controls. Second, it aligns tool implementations with both
database privileges and user security policies to steer LLMs away from unsafe
or unauthorized operations, improving task execution efficiency while
safeguarding database security. Third, it introduces a proxy mechanism for
seamless inter-tool data transfer, bypassing LLM transmission bottlenecks. All
of these designs are database-agnostic and can be transparently integrated with
existing agent architectures. We also release an open-source implementation of
BridgeScope for PostgreSQL. Evaluations on two novel benchmarks demonstrate
that BridgeScope enables LLM agents to operate databases more effectively,
reduces token usage by up to 80% through improved security awareness, and
uniquely supports data-intensive workflows beyond existing toolkits,
establishing BridgeScope as a robust foundation for next-generation intelligent
data automation.

Result: Sirius, a prototype open-source GPU-native SQL engine, offers drop-in acceleration for diverse data systems.

Conclusion: Sirius achieves 7x speedup when integrated with DuckDB and up to 12.5x speedup when integrated with Apache Doris.

Abstract: The era of GPU-powered data analytics has arrived. In this paper, we argue
that recent advances in hardware (e.g., larger GPU memory, faster interconnect
and IO, and declining cost) and software (e.g., composable data systems and
mature libraries) have removed the key barriers that have limited the wider
adoption of GPU data analytics. We present Sirius, a prototype open-source
GPU-native SQL engine that offers drop-in acceleration for diverse data
systems. Sirius treats GPU as the primary engine and leverages libraries like
libcudf for high-performance relational operators. It provides drop-in
acceleration for existing databases by leveraging the standard Substrait query
representation, replacing the CPU engine without changing the user-facing
interface. On TPC-H, Sirius achieves 7x speedup when integrated with DuckDB in
a single node at the same hardware rental cost, and up to 12.5x speedup when
integrated with Apache Doris in a distributed setting.

Motivation: designing a universal recommendation architecture, decreasing excessive maintenance costs, and managing a highly dynamic product catalogue

Method: a unified content-based recommendation system built on a Two Tower retrieval framework

Result: significant gains in engagement and profit-based metrics across desktop and mobile app channels

Conclusion: A flexible, scalable architecture can serve diverse user intents with minimal maintenance overhead.

Abstract: Building large-scale e-commerce recommendation systems requires addressing
three key technical challenges: (1) designing a universal recommendation
architecture across dozens of placements, (2) decreasing excessive maintenance
costs, and (3) managing a highly dynamic product catalogue. This paper presents
a unified content-based recommendation system deployed at Allegro.com, the
largest e-commerce platform of European origin. The system is built on a
prevalent Two Tower retrieval framework, representing products using textual
and structured attributes, which enables efficient retrieval via Approximate
Nearest Neighbour search. We demonstrate how the same model architecture can be
adapted to serve three distinct recommendation tasks: similarity search,
complementary product suggestions, and inspirational content discovery, by
modifying only a handful of components in either the model or the serving
logic. Extensive A/B testing over two years confirms significant gains in
engagement and profit-based metrics across desktop and mobile app channels. Our
results show that a flexible, scalable architecture can serve diverse user
intents with minimal maintenance overhead.

TL;DR: LLM赋能的推荐系统容易受到重建攻击，可能暴露用户隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统在处理冷启动用户或具有新ID的物品时存在局限性。LLM赋能的推荐系统被提出以解决这些限制，但研究发现它们容易受到重建攻击，从而暴露系统和用户隐私。

Method: 提出了一种名为相似性引导细化的优化方法，改进了vec2text框架，以更准确地从模型生成的logits重建文本提示。

Result: 在电影和书籍两个领域以及两个代表性的基于LLM的推荐模型上的大量实验表明，该方法实现了高保真重建。具体来说，可以恢复近65%的用户交互项目，并在87%的情况下正确推断年龄和性别。实验还表明，隐私泄露在很大程度上对受害者模型的性能不敏感，但高度依赖于领域一致性和提示复杂性。

Conclusion: LLM赋能的推荐系统存在严重隐私漏洞。

Abstract: The large language model (LLM) powered recommendation paradigm has been
proposed to address the limitations of traditional recommender systems, which
often struggle to handle cold start users or items with new IDs. Despite its
effectiveness, this study uncovers that LLM empowered recommender systems are
vulnerable to reconstruction attacks that can expose both system and user
privacy. To examine this threat, we present the first systematic study on
inversion attacks targeting LLM empowered recommender systems, where
adversaries attempt to reconstruct original prompts that contain personal
preferences, interaction histories, and demographic attributes by exploiting
the output logits of recommendation models. We reproduce the vec2text framework
and optimize it using our proposed method called Similarity Guided Refinement,
enabling more accurate reconstruction of textual prompts from model generated
logits. Extensive experiments across two domains (movies and books) and two
representative LLM based recommendation models demonstrate that our method
achieves high fidelity reconstructions. Specifically, we can recover nearly 65
percent of the user interacted items and correctly infer age and gender in 87
percent of the cases. The experiments also reveal that privacy leakage is
largely insensitive to the victim model's performance but highly dependent on
domain consistency and prompt complexity. These findings expose critical
privacy vulnerabilities in LLM empowered recommender systems.

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have become deeply
embedded in our everyday life, offering a dynamic stream of localized news and
personal experiences. The ubiquity of these platforms position them as valuable
resources for identifying estate-related issues, especially in the context of
growing urban populations. In this work, we present a language model-based
system for the detection and classification of estate-related events from
social media content. Our system employs a hierarchical classification
framework to first filter relevant posts and then categorize them into
actionable estate-related topics. Additionally, for posts lacking explicit
geotags, we apply a transformer-based geolocation module to infer posting
locations at the point-of-interest level. This integrated approach supports
timely, data-driven insights for urban management, operational response and
situational awareness.

### [133] [Measuring the stability and plasticity of recommender systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03941)
*Maria João Lavoura,Robert Jungnickel,João Vinagre*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new offline evaluation protocol to study the long-term behavior of recommendation models when they are retrained, focusing on stability and plasticity. Preliminary results suggest a trade-off between these two factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The typical offline protocol only captures performance of a particular model trained at some point in the past, while online systems evolve over time. It is important for models to reflect such changes, so models are frequently retrained with recent data. Thus, the paper aims to address the question of to what extent we can trust previous evaluations.

Method: The idea is to profile algorithms according to their ability to, on the one hand, retain past patterns -- stability -- and, on the other hand, (quickly) adapt to changes -- plasticity. We devise an offline evaluation protocol that provides detail on the long-term behavior of models, and that is agnostic to datasets, algorithms and metrics.

Result: Preliminary results of three different types of algorithms on the GoodReads dataset suggest different stability and plasticity profiles depending on the algorithmic technique.

Conclusion: This paper proposes a methodology to study how recommendation models behave when they are retrained and suggests a possible trade-off between stability and plasticity.

Abstract: The typical offline protocol to evaluate recommendation algorithms is to
collect a dataset of user-item interactions and then use a part of this dataset
to train a model, and the remaining data to measure how closely the model
recommendations match the observed user interactions. This protocol is
straightforward, useful and practical, but it only captures performance of a
particular model trained at some point in the past. We know, however, that
online systems evolve over time. In general, it is a good idea that models
reflect such changes, so models are frequently retrained with recent data. But
if this is the case, to what extent can we trust previous evaluations? How will
a model perform when a different pattern (re)emerges? In this paper we propose
a methodology to study how recommendation models behave when they are
retrained. The idea is to profile algorithms according to their ability to, on
the one hand, retain past patterns -- stability -- and, on the other hand,
(quickly) adapt to changes -- plasticity. We devise an offline evaluation
protocol that provides detail on the long-term behavior of models, and that is
agnostic to datasets, algorithms and metrics. To illustrate the potential of
this framework, we present preliminary results of three different types of
algorithms on the GoodReads dataset that suggest different stability and
plasticity profiles depending on the algorithmic technique, and a possible
trade-off between stability and plasticity.Although additional experiments will
be necessary to confirm these observations, they already illustrate the
usefulness of the proposed framework to gain insights on the long term dynamics
of recommendation models.

Motivation: 通过多轮交互满足用户复杂的信息需求。关键挑战在于从上下文相关的查询中揭示真实用户的搜索意图。先前研究通过微调对话式密集检索器来实现对话式搜索，但这种训练范例遇到数据稀缺问题。

Method: ConvMix，一个混合标准框架，用于增强对话式密集检索。

Result: 在五个广泛使用的基准测试中，实验结果表明 ConvMix 框架训练的对话式密集检索器优于先前的基线方法。

Conclusion: ConvMix 训练的对话式密集检索器优于先前的基线方法，证明了其卓越的有效性。

Abstract: Conversational search aims to satisfy users' complex information needs via
multiple-turn interactions. The key challenge lies in revealing real users'
search intent from the context-dependent queries. Previous studies achieve
conversational search by fine-tuning a conversational dense retriever with
relevance judgments between pairs of context-dependent queries and documents.
However, this training paradigm encounters data scarcity issues. To this end,
we propose ConvMix, a mixed-criteria framework to augment conversational dense
retrieval, which covers more aspects than existing data augmentation
frameworks. We design a two-sided relevance judgment augmentation schema in a
scalable manner via the aid of large language models. Besides, we integrate the
framework with quality control mechanisms to obtain semantically diverse
samples and near-distribution supervisions to combine various annotated data.
Experimental results on five widely used benchmarks show that the
conversational dense retriever trained by our ConvMix framework outperforms
previous baseline methods, which demonstrates our superior effectiveness.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a LLM-based method to enhance recommendation serendipity by dynamically constructing user knowledge graphs. Experiments on the Dewu app show improved novelty and user engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial recommendation systems suffer from feedback loops that reinforce homogeneous content, creating filter bubbles and diminishing user satisfaction. LLMs offer potential for serendipity recommendation but face challenges in rationality, usefulness, and latency.

Method: The method involves a two-stage framework: (1) two-hop interest reasoning using LLMs to construct user knowledge graphs and identify potential interests; and (2) near-line adaptation with a u2i retrieval model incorporating i2i capabilities.

Result: Online experiments on the Dewu app demonstrate that the method increased the exposure novelty rate by 4.62%, the click novelty rate by 4.85%, the average view duration per person by 0.15%, unique visitor click through rate by 0.07%, and unique visitor interaction penetration by 0.30%.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a method using LLMs to dynamically construct user knowledge graphs for enhancing serendipity in recommendation systems. Online experiments on the Dewu app show improvements in exposure novelty rate, click novelty rate, average view duration, unique visitor click through rate, and unique visitor interaction penetration.

Abstract: The feedback loop in industrial recommendation systems reinforces homogeneous
content, creates filter bubble effects, and diminishes user satisfaction.
Recently, large language models(LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
serendipity recommendation, thanks to their extensive world knowledge and
superior reasoning capabilities. However, these models still face challenges in
ensuring the rationality of the reasoning process, the usefulness of the
reasoning results, and meeting the latency requirements of industrial
recommendation systems (RSs). To address these challenges, we propose a method
that leverages llm to dynamically construct user knowledge graphs, thereby
enhancing the serendipity of recommendation systems. This method comprises a
two stage framework:(1) two-hop interest reasoning, where user static profiles
and historical behaviors are utilized to dynamically construct user knowledge
graphs via llm. Two-hop reasoning, which can enhance the quality and accuracy
of LLM reasoning results, is then performed on the constructed graphs to
identify users' potential interests; and(2) Near-line adaptation, a
cost-effective approach to deploying the aforementioned models in industrial
recommendation systems. We propose a u2i (user-to-item) retrieval model that
also incorporates i2i (item-to-item) retrieval capabilities, the retrieved
items not only exhibit strong relevance to users' newly emerged interests but
also retain the high conversion rate of traditional u2i retrieval. Our online
experiments on the Dewu app, which has tens of millions of users, indicate that
the method increased the exposure novelty rate by 4.62%, the click novelty rate
by 4.85%, the average view duration per person by 0.15%, unique visitor click
through rate by 0.07%, and unique visitor interaction penetration by 0.30%,
enhancing user experience.

TL;DR: GSERec利用用户-代码图上的消息传递来缓解搜索增强推荐中的数据稀疏性，从而提高推荐性能，尤其对于搜索行为稀疏的用户。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明，结合搜索信号可以提高推荐性能。然而，这些方法的有效性在很大程度上依赖于丰富的搜索交互。它们主要使一小部分具有丰富搜索行为的用户受益，而对于大多数仅表现出稀疏搜索活动的用户，改进有限。为了解决搜索增强推荐中稀疏搜索数据的问题，我们面临两个关键挑战：(1) 如何为具有稀疏搜索交互的用户学习有用的搜索特征，以及 (2) 如何在稀疏条件下设计有效的训练目标。

Method: GSERec，一种利用用户-代码图上的消息传递来缓解搜索增强推荐中的数据稀疏性的方法。它利用具有向量量化的大型语言模型 (LLM) 生成离散代码，这些代码连接相似的用户，从而构建图。通过在此图上进行消息传递，具有丰富搜索数据的用户的嵌入被传播以增强具有稀疏交互的用户的嵌入。此外，引入对比损失以更好地模拟用户相似性。

Result: GSERec始终优于基线，尤其是在搜索行为稀疏的用户中。

Conclusion: GSERec在三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法始终优于基线，尤其是在搜索行为稀疏的用户中。

Abstract: In modern online platforms, search and recommendation (S&R) often coexist,
offering opportunities for performance improvement through search-enhanced
approaches. Existing studies show that incorporating search signals boosts
recommendation performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods relies
heavily on rich search interactions. They primarily benefit a small subset of
users with abundant search behavior, while offering limited improvements for
the majority of users who exhibit only sparse search activity. To address the
problem of sparse search data in search-enhanced recommendation, we face two
key challenges: (1) how to learn useful search features for users with sparse
search interactions, and (2) how to design effective training objectives under
sparse conditions. Our idea is to leverage the features of users with rich
search interactions to enhance those of users with sparse search interactions.
Based on this idea, we propose GSERec, a method that utilizes message passing
on the User-Code Graphs to alleviate data sparsity in Search-Enhanced
Recommendation. Specifically, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) with
vector quantization to generate discrete codes, which connect similar users and
thereby construct the graph. Through message passing on this graph, embeddings
of users with rich search data are propagated to enhance the embeddings of
users with sparse interactions. To further ensure that the message passing
captures meaningful information from truly similar users, we introduce a
contrastive loss to better model user similarities. The enhanced user
representations are then integrated into downstream search-enhanced
recommendation models. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that
GSERec consistently outperforms baselines, especially for users with sparse
search behaviors.

TL;DR: 设计了一个潜在的交叉推理框架，通过对比学习和强化学习，从用户搜索历史中提取有益于推荐的信号，以提高推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效利用搜索行为来改进推荐仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。用户搜索历史通常包含嘈杂或不相关的信号，这些信号甚至会降低推荐性能，而现有方法通常共同或单独编码搜索历史，而没有明确识别哪些搜索行为真正有用。受到人类决策过程的启发，人们首先识别推荐意图，然后推断相关证据。

Method: 设计了一种潜在的交叉推理框架，该框架首先编码用户搜索历史以捕获全局兴趣，然后迭代地推理搜索行为，以提取有益于推荐的信号。采用对比学习来使潜在的推理状态与目标项目对齐，并进一步引入强化学习来直接优化排名性能。

Result: 相对于强大的基线，该方法能够持续改进，验证了推理在增强搜索感知推荐中的重要性。

Conclusion: 在公共基准上的大量实验表明，相对于强大的基线，该方法能够持续改进，验证了推理在增强搜索感知推荐中的重要性。

Abstract: Search and recommendation (S&R) are fundamental components of modern online
platforms, yet effectively leveraging search behaviors to improve
recommendation remains a challenging problem. User search histories often
contain noisy or irrelevant signals that can even degrade recommendation
performance, while existing approaches typically encode S&R histories either
jointly or separately without explicitly identifying which search behaviors are
truly useful. Inspired by the human decision-making process, where one first
identifies recommendation intent and then reasons about relevant evidence, we
design a latent cross reasoning framework that first encodes user S&R histories
to capture global interests and then iteratively reasons over search behaviors
to extract signals beneficial for recommendation. Contrastive learning is
employed to align latent reasoning states with target items, and reinforcement
learning is further introduced to directly optimize ranking performance.
Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements
over strong baselines, validating the importance of reasoning in enhancing
search-aware recommendation.

Abstract: Recommending long-form video content demands joint modeling of visual, audio,
and textual modalities, yet most benchmarks address only raw features or narrow
fusion. We present ViLLA-MMBench, a reproducible, extensible benchmark for
LLM-augmented multimodal movie recommendation. Built on MovieLens and MMTF-14K,
it aligns dense item embeddings from three modalities: audio (block-level,
i-vector), visual (CNN, AVF), and text. Missing or sparse metadata is
automatically enriched using state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., OpenAI Ada),
generating high-quality synopses for thousands of movies. All text (raw or
augmented) is embedded with configurable encoders (Ada, LLaMA-2, Sentence-T5),
producing multiple ready-to-use sets. The pipeline supports interchangeable
early-, mid-, and late-fusion (concatenation, PCA, CCA, rank-aggregation) and
multiple backbones (MF, VAECF, VBPR, AMR, VMF) for ablation. Experiments are
fully declarative via a single YAML file. Evaluation spans accuracy (Recall,
nDCG) and beyond-accuracy metrics: cold-start rate, coverage, novelty,
diversity, fairness. Results show LLM-based augmentation and strong text
embeddings boost cold-start and coverage, especially when fused with
audio-visual features. Systematic benchmarking reveals universal versus
backbone- or metric-specific combinations. Open-source code, embeddings, and

TL;DR: 本文分析了如何在分解式推荐模型中编码时间。通过包含绝对时间作为特征，该模型可以学习随时间变化的用户偏好和商品感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统从过去的用户行为中学习，以预测未来的用户偏好。直观地，已经确定最近的互动比旧的互动更能指示未来的偏好。许多推荐算法使用这个概念来删除旧的互动或给它们分配较低的权重，因此模型可以专注于更有信息量的、最近的信息。然而，很少有方法明确地模拟时间的流逝。

Method: 通过在分解式推荐模型中包含绝对时间作为特征，我们的模型可以学习随时间变化的用户偏好和不断变化的商品感知。除了简单的分箱方法外，我们还提出了一种新颖的、完全连续的时间编码机制。通过在损失函数中使用多项式拟合，我们的模型完全避免了离散化的需要，并且能够以任意分辨率捕获时间维度。

Result: 通过对跨越多年的三个真实世界数据集进行比较研究，其中存在长期的用户历史，并且商品在更长的时间内保持相关性。实证结果表明，通过显式建模时间，我们的模型能够非常有效地捕获时间信号，例如随时间变化的商品受欢迎程度。尽管如此，我们的实验也表明，一个简单的事后受欢迎程度调整通常足以在看不见的测试集上获得最佳性能。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模时间，我们的模型能够非常有效地捕获时间信号，例如随时间变化的商品受欢迎程度。然而，我们的实验也表明，一个简单的事后受欢迎程度调整通常足以在看不见的测试集上获得最佳性能。这告诉我们，对于推荐任务来说，预测未来比捕捉过去的趋势更重要。因此，我们认为需要专门的机制来进行未来数据的推断。

Abstract: Recommender systems learn from past user behavior to predict future user
preferences. Intuitively, it has been established that the most recent
interactions are more indicative of future preferences than older interactions.
Many recommendation algorithms use this notion to either drop older
interactions or to assign them a lower weight, so the model can focus on the
more informative, recent information. However, very few approaches model the
flow of time explicitly.
  This paper analyzes how time can be encoded in factorization-style
recommendation models. By including absolute time as a feature, our models can
learn varying user preferences and changing item perception over time. In
addition to simple binning approaches, we also propose a novel, fully
continuous time encoding mechanism. Through the use of a polynomial fit inside
the loss function, our models completely avoid the need for discretization, and
they are able to capture the time dimension in arbitrary resolution.
  We perform a comparative study on three real-world datasets that span
multiple years, where long user histories are present, and items stay relevant
for a longer time. Empirical results show that, by explicitly modeling time,
our models are very effective at capturing temporal signals, such as varying
item popularities over time. Despite this however, our experiments also
indicate that a simple post-hoc popularity adjustment is often sufficient to
achieve the best performance on the unseen test set. This teaches us that, for
the recommendation task, predicting the future is more important than capturing
past trends. As such, we argue that specialized mechanisms are needed for
extrapolation to future data.

Motivation: 由于图像缺失、描述不完整或用户内容不一致，并非所有模态都可用，这大大降低了当前模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 使用不变学习与信息瓶颈原则的I3-MRec

Result: I3-MRec在三个真实世界数据集上进行了大量实验，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: I3-MRec在各种模态缺失场景中始终优于现有的最先进的MRS方法，突出了其在实际应用中的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal recommender systems (MRS) improve recommendation performance by
integrating diverse semantic information from multiple modalities. However, the
assumption of the availability of all modalities rarely holds in practice due
to missing images, incomplete descriptions, or inconsistent user content. These
challenges significantly degrade the robustness and generalization capabilities
of current models. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel method
called \textbf{I$^3$-MRec}, which uses \textbf{I}nvariant learning with
\textbf{I}nformation bottleneck principle for \textbf{I}ncomplete
\textbf{M}odality \textbf{Rec}ommendation. To achieve robust performance in
missing modality scenarios, I$^3$-MRec enforces two pivotal properties: (i)
cross-modal preference invariance, which ensures consistent user preference
modeling across varying modality environments, and (ii) compact yet effective
modality representation, which filters out task-irrelevant modality information
while maximally preserving essential features relevant to recommendation. By
treating each modality as a distinct semantic environment, I$^3$-MRec employs
invariant risk minimization (IRM) to learn modality-specific item
representations. In parallel, a missing-aware fusion module grounded in the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle extracts compact and effective item
embeddings by suppressing modality noise and preserving core user preference
signals. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets
demonstrate that I$^3$-MRec consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art
MRS methods across various modality-missing scenarios, highlighting its
effectiveness and robustness in practical applications. The code and processed
datasets are released at https://github.com/HuilinChenJN/I3-MRec.

Conclusion: 即使是静态源代码指标也提供了有价值的预测信号，为构建更强大和智能的推荐系统提供了一个有希望的方向。

Abstract: The Algorithm Selection Problem for recommender systems-choosing the best
algorithm for a given user or context-remains a significant challenge.
Traditional meta-learning approaches often treat algorithms as categorical
choices, ignoring their intrinsic properties. Recent work has shown that
explicitly characterizing algorithms with features can improve model
performance in other domains. Building on this, we propose a per-user
meta-learning approach for recommender system selection that leverages both
user meta-features and automatically extracted algorithm features from source
code. Our preliminary results, averaged over six diverse datasets, show that
augmenting a meta-learner with algorithm features improves its average NDCG@10
performance by 8.83% from 0.135 (user features only) to 0.147. This enhanced
model outperforms the Single Best Algorithm baseline (0.131) and successfully
closes 10.5% of the performance gap to a theoretical oracle selector. These
findings show that even static source code metrics provide a valuable
predictive signal, presenting a promising direction for building more robust

Conclusion: TRAIL在多个基准测试中优于现有的KG增强和检索增强的LLM基线3%到13%。这些结果代表了朝着开发自适应、记忆增强的语言模型迈出的重要一步，该模型能够持续学习和可靠、透明的推理。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked powerful
reasoning and decision-making capabilities. However, their inherent dependence
on static parametric memory fundamentally limits their adaptability, factual
accuracy, and interpretability in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Knowledge
graphs (KGs), as structured repositories of explicit relational knowledge,
offer a promising approach for augmenting LLMs with external, interpretable
memory. Nevertheless, most existing methods that combine LLMs with KGs treat
reasoning and knowledge updating as separate processes, resulting in suboptimal
utilization of new information and hindering real-time updates. In this work,
we propose TRAIL: a novel, unified framework for Thinking, Reasoning, And
Incremental Learning that couples joint inference and dynamic KG refinement
with large language models. TRAIL enables LLM agents to iteratively explore,
update, and refine knowledge graphs during the reasoning process, employing a
confidence-driven mechanism for the generation, validation, and pruning of new
facts. This plug-and-play architecture facilitates seamless integration with
various LLMs, supporting continual adaptation without the need for retraining.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TRAIL outperforms
existing KG-augmented and retrieval-augmented LLM baselines by 3% to 13%. More
importantly, these results represent a significant step toward developing
adaptive, memory-augmented language models capable of continual learning and
reliable, transparent reasoning.

Conclusion: LVLMs 可以作为在推荐任务中构建强大且有意义的多模态表示的基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Recommender Systems aim to improve recommendation accuracy by
integrating heterogeneous content, such as images and textual metadata. While
effective, it remains unclear whether their gains stem from true multimodal
understanding or increased model complexity. This work investigates the role of
multimodal item embeddings, emphasizing the semantic informativeness of the
representations. Initial experiments reveal that embeddings from standard
extractors (e.g., ResNet50, Sentence-Bert) enhance performance, but rely on
modality-specific encoders and ad hoc fusion strategies that lack control over
cross-modal alignment. To overcome these limitations, we leverage Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multimodal-by-design embeddings via
structured prompts. This approach yields semantically aligned representations
without requiring any fusion. Experiments across multiple settings show notable
performance improvements. Furthermore, LVLMs embeddings offer a distinctive
advantage: they can be decoded into structured textual descriptions, enabling
direct assessment of their multimodal comprehension. When such descriptions are
incorporated as side content into recommender systems, they improve
recommendation performance, empirically validating the semantic depth and
alignment encoded within LVLMs outputs. Our study highlights the importance of
semantically rich representations and positions LVLMs as a compelling
foundation for building robust and meaningful multimodal representations in
recommendation tasks.

near-linear scalability with eight CPU workers. Three case studies -- AWD-LSTM

### [147] [HiD-VAE: Interpretable Generative Recommendation via Hierarchical and Disentangled Semantic IDs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04618)
*Dengzhao Fang,Jingtong Gao,Chengcheng Zhu,Yu Li,Xiangyu Zhao,Yi Chang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: HiD-VAE是一种新框架，它通过分层监督量化过程和唯一性损失来学习分层解耦的物品表示，从而克服了现有生成推荐方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成方法受到其无监督标记化的根本限制，这会生成语义ID，这些ID存在两个关键缺陷：(1) 它们在语义上是扁平且不可解释的，缺乏连贯的层次结构；(2) 它们容易出现表示纠缠（即“ID冲突”），这会损害推荐准确性和多样性。

Method: HiD-VAE通过两个核心创新学习分层解耦的物品表示：1) 首创分层监督量化过程，将离散代码与多层次物品标签对齐，产生更均匀和解耦的ID。2) 引入了一种新颖的唯一性损失，直接惩罚潜在空间重叠。

Result: HiD-VAE不仅解决了关键的ID冲突问题，而且通过确保更全面地利用物品表示空间，从而提高了推荐的多样性。

Conclusion: HiD-VAE在三个公共基准数据集上，通过大量实验验证了其相对于现有最佳方法的卓越性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems are indispensable for helping users navigate the immense
item catalogs of modern online platforms. Recently, generative recommendation
has emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional
retrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic
generation. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained
by their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from
two critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking
a coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement
(i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity.
To overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that
learns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core
innovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization
process that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more
uniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict
hierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for
each recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE
incorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space
overlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but
also promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive
utilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled
IDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models. Extensive
experiments on three public benchmarks validate HiD-VAE's superior performance
against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Conclusion: 这本书全面介绍了生成模型及其应用，特别关注深度生成模型（DGM）及其分类。 我们提出了一个分类法，将 DGM 分为三种类型：ID 驱动模型、大型语言模型 (LLM) 和多模态模型。

Abstract: Generative models are a class of AI models capable of creating new instances
of data by learning and sampling from their statistical distributions. In
recent years, these models have gained prominence in machine learning due to
the development of approaches such as generative adversarial networks (GANs),
variational autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer-based architectures such as
GPT. These models have applications across various domains, such as image
generation, text synthesis, and music composition. In recommender systems,
generative models, referred to as Gen-RecSys, improve the accuracy and
diversity of recommendations by generating structured outputs, text-based
interactions, and multimedia content. By leveraging these capabilities,
Gen-RecSys can produce more personalized, engaging, and dynamic user
experiences, expanding the role of AI in eCommerce, media, and beyond.
  Our book goes beyond existing literature by offering a comprehensive
understanding of generative models and their applications, with a special focus
on deep generative models (DGMs) and their classification. We introduce a
taxonomy that categorizes DGMs into three types: ID-driven models, large
language models (LLMs), and multimodal models. Each category addresses unique
technical and architectural advancements within its respective research area.
This taxonomy allows researchers to easily navigate developments in Gen-RecSys
across domains such as conversational AI and multimodal content generation.
Additionally, we examine the impact and potential risks of generative models,
emphasizing the importance of robust evaluation frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感计算在深度学习方面取得了显著进展，但仍然存在一个持续的挑战：情感模型从受控实验室环境（体外）到不受控的真实世界环境（体内）的可靠转移。

Method: Privileged Contrastive Pretraining (PriCon)

Result: 在两个基准情感语料库 RECOLA 和 AGAIN 上进行的实验表明，使用 PriCon 训练的模型始终优于 LUPI 和端到端模型。在许多情况下，PriCon 模型的性能与在训练和测试期间可以访问所有模态的模型相当。

Conclusion: Privileged Contrastive Pretraining (PriCon) 是一种有潜力弥合体外和体内情感建模之间差距的范例，为实际应用提供可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Affective Computing (AC) has made significant progress with the advent of
deep learning, yet a persistent challenge remains: the reliable transfer of
affective models from controlled laboratory settings (in-vitro) to uncontrolled
real-world environments (in-vivo). To address this challenge we introduce the
Privileged Contrastive Pretraining (PriCon) framework according to which models
are first pretrained via supervised contrastive learning (SCL) and then act as
teacher models within a Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) framework.
PriCon both leverages privileged information during training and enhances the
robustness of derived affect models via SCL. Experiments conducted on two
benchmark affective corpora, RECOLA and AGAIN, demonstrate that models trained
using PriCon consistently outperform LUPI and end to end models. Remarkably, in
many cases, PriCon models achieve performance comparable to models trained with
access to all modalities during both training and testing. The findings
underscore the potential of PriCon as a paradigm towards further bridging the
gap between in-vitro and in-vivo affective modelling, offering a scalable and
practical solution for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹压缩方法通常假设为2D轨迹，忽略时间同步和运动连续性。

Method: 该框架结合了频域物理建模与误差界限优化。

Result: PILOT-C在多个维度上都表现出优越的性能。

Conclusion: PILOT-C在压缩率上优于CISED-W 19.2%，误差减少32.6%，且在3D轨迹上优于SQUISH-E 49%。

Abstract: Location-aware devices continuously generate massive volumes of trajectory
data, creating demand for efficient compression. Line simplification is a
common solution but typically assumes 2D trajectories and ignores time
synchronization and motion continuity. We propose PILOT-C, a novel trajectory
compression framework that integrates frequency-domain physics modeling with
error-bounded optimization. Unlike existing line simplification methods,
PILOT-C supports trajectories in arbitrary dimensions, including 3D, by
compressing each spatial axis independently. Evaluated on four real-world
datasets, PILOT-C achieves superior performance across multiple dimensions. In
terms of compression ratio, PILOT-C outperforms CISED-W, the current
state-of-the-art SED-based line simplification algorithm, by an average of
19.2%. For trajectory fidelity, PILOT-C achieves an average of 32.6% reduction
in error compared to CISED-W. Additionally, PILOT-C seamlessly extends to
three-dimensional trajectories while maintaining the same computational
complexity, achieving a 49% improvement in compression ratios over SQUISH-E,
the most efficient line simplification algorithm on 3D datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models lack verifiable supervision of the reasoning process, leading to challenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse rewards, and frequent hallucinations.

Method: A generative model (CX-Mind) with interleaved "think-answer" reasoning, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and verifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Utilizes a constructed instruction-tuning dataset (CX-Set) and Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: CX-Mind achieves an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable CXR-specific models and substantially surpasses the second-best results on the Rui-CXR dataset. Multi-center expert evaluations confirm its clinical utility.

Conclusion: CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing models in CXR diagnosis, achieving substantial improvements in performance and demonstrating clinical utility.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic
modalities in clinical practice, encompassing a broad spectrum of diagnostic
tasks. Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of
reasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to
enhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability. However, existing
multimodal models predominantly rely on "one-time" diagnostic approaches,
lacking verifiable supervision of the reasoning process. This leads to
challenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse
rewards, and frequent hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose
CX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved "think-answer"
reasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and
verifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an
instruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148
samples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points
supervised by clinical reports. Optimization was conducted in two stages under
the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework: initially stabilizing basic
reasoning with closed-domain tasks, followed by transfer to open-domain
diagnostics, incorporating rule-based conditional process rewards to bypass the
need for pretrained reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain
MLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment,
achieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable
CXR-specific models. On real-world clinical dataset (Rui-CXR), CX-Mind achieves
a mean recall@1 across 14 diseases that substantially surpasses the second-best
results, with multi-center expert evaluations further confirming its clinical
utility across multiple dimensions.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of glaucoma is critical to prevent irreversible

a transformer-based language model. These heterogeneous signals, combined with
manually assessed risk scores and quantitative ophthalmic indicators, are fused
into a unified feature space for classification via an enhanced XGBoost model.

TL;DR: 提出LRTuckerRep模型，在补全精度和鲁棒性上优于基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常利用全局低秩逼近或局部平滑正则化，但每种方法都有明显的局限性：低秩方法计算成本高昂，可能会破坏内在的数据结构，而基于平滑性的方法通常需要大量的手动参数调整，并且泛化能力较差。

Method: 提出了一个新的低秩 Tucker 表示 (LRTuckerRep) 模型，该模型在 Tucker 分解中统一了全局和局部先验建模。通过因子矩阵上的自适应加权核范数和稀疏 Tucker 核心来编码低秩性，同时通过因子空间上基于拉普拉斯的无参数正则化来捕获平滑性。为了有效地解决由此产生的非凸优化问题，我们开发了两种具有可证明收敛保证的迭代算法。

Result: LRTuckerRep 实现了优于基线的补全精度和在高缺失率下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LRTuckerRep在多维图像修复和交通数据插补方面，相比基线方法，实现了更高的补全精度和在高缺失率下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-dimensional data completion is a critical problem in computational
sciences, particularly in domains such as computer vision, signal processing,
and scientific computing. Existing methods typically leverage either global
low-rank approximations or local smoothness regularization, but each suffers
from notable limitations: low-rank methods are computationally expensive and
may disrupt intrinsic data structures, while smoothness-based approaches often
require extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit poor generalization. In
this paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep)
model that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker
decomposition. Specifically, LRTuckerRep encodes low rankness through a
self-adaptive weighted nuclear norm on the factor matrices and a sparse Tucker
core, while capturing smoothness via a parameter-free Laplacian-based
regularization on the factor spaces. To efficiently solve the resulting
nonconvex optimization problem, we develop two iterative algorithms with
provable convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional
image inpainting and traffic data imputation demonstrate that LRTuckerRep
achieves superior completion accuracy and robustness under high missing rates
compared to baselines.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in real-world
deployments due to the sim-to-real gap, where policies trained in simulators
often underperform in practice due to mismatches between training and
deployment conditions. Distributionally robust RL addresses this issue by
optimizing worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of environments and
providing an optimized lower bound on deployment performance. However, existing
studies typically assume access to either a generative model or offline
datasets with broad coverage of the deployment environment -- assumptions that
limit their practicality in unknown environments without prior knowledge. In
this work, we study the more realistic and challenging setting of online
distributionally robust RL, where the agent interacts only with a single
unknown training environment while aiming to optimize its worst-case
performance. We focus on general $f$-divergence-based uncertainty sets,
including Chi-Square and KL divergence balls, and propose a computationally
efficient algorithm with sublinear regret guarantees under minimal assumptions.
Furthermore, we establish a minimax lower bound on regret of online learning,
demonstrating the near-optimality of our approach. Extensive experiments across
diverse environments further confirm the robustness and efficiency of our
algorithm, validating our theoretical findings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GTPO to address the limitations of GRPO, which achieves greater training stability and improved performance without relying on KL-divergence regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning.

Method: We introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold.

Result: Validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.

Conclusion: GTPO can achieve greater training stability and improved performance without relying on KL-divergence regularization.

Abstract: Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and
alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective
approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we
reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear
in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting
gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be
essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded
completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward
unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading
learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective
policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative
Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens
appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards,
protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To
further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy
exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence
regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training,
while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance,
validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical solvers offer high accuracy, but suffer from scalability issues and substantial computational costs. Pure data-driven deep learning approaches, while efficient, lack physical constraints embedding during training and require extensive labeled data, limiting their applicability and generalization.

Method: a U-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet), the first fully deep-learning-based, physics-informed hierarchical framework for computational EM designed to ensure physical consistency while maximizing computational efficiency. It models the decomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a multiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a physics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self- and mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex 3-Dimensional (3D) objects.

Result: achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while significantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep learning baselines in both accuracy and robustness

Conclusion: U-PINet accurately predicts surface current distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while significantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep learning baselines in both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, evaluations on radar cross section prediction tasks confirm the feasibility of the U-PINet for downstream EM scattering applications.

Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) scattering modeling is critical for radar remote
sensing, however, its inherent complexity introduces significant computational
challenges. Traditional numerical solvers offer high accuracy, but suffer from
scalability issues and substantial computational costs. Pure data-driven deep
learning approaches, while efficient, lack physical constraints embedding
during training and require extensive labeled data, limiting their
applicability and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
U-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet), the first fully
deep-learning-based, physics-informed hierarchical framework for computational
EM designed to ensure physical consistency while maximizing computational
efficiency. Motivated by the hierarchical decomposition strategy in EM solvers
and the inherent sparsity of local EM coupling, the U-PINet models the
decomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a
multiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a
physics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self-
and mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex $3$-Dimensional (3D)
objects. This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering

Conclusion: The proposed thermal conduction physics-informed neural network achieves accuracy comparable to the finite element method, while achieving ×40 times acceleration in computational efficiency.

Abstract: Estimating heat flux in the nuclear fusion device EAST is a critically
important task. Traditional scientific computing methods typically model this
process using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, FEM relies on
grid-based sampling for computation, which is computationally inefficient and
hard to perform real-time simulations during actual experiments. Inspired by
artificial intelligence-powered scientific computing, this paper proposes a
novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to address this challenge,
significantly accelerating the heat conduction estimation process while
maintaining high accuracy. Specifically, given inputs of different materials,
we first feed spatial coordinates and time stamps into the neural network, and
compute boundary loss, initial condition loss, and physical loss based on the
heat conduction equation. Additionally, we sample a small number of data points
in a data-driven manner to better fit the specific heat conduction scenario,
further enhancing the model's predictive capability. We conduct experiments
under both uniform and non-uniform heating conditions on the top surface.
Experimental results show that the proposed thermal conduction physics-informed
neural network achieves accuracy comparable to the finite element method, while
achieving $\times$40 times acceleration in computational efficiency. The
dataset and source code will be released on

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SoilNet, a multimodal multitask model for soil horizon classification, addressing challenges like multimodality, multitask nature, and hierarchical label taxonomy. It integrates image and geotemporal data to predict soil horizons, demonstrating effectiveness on a real-world dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate classification of soil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts agricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate resilience. Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains challenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a complex hierarchically structured label taxonomy.

Method: We propose $\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal multitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized pipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first predict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates.  Each segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological features. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal concatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to account for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons.

Result: Our method is designed to address complex hierarchical classification, where the number of possible labels is very large, imbalanced and non-trivially structured.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on a real-world soil profile dataset.

Abstract: While recent advances in foundation models have improved the state of the art
in many domains, some problems in empirical sciences could not benefit from
this progress yet. Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains
challenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a

soil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts
agricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate
resilience. In this work, we propose $\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal
multitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized
pipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first
predict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates.
Each segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological

Motivation: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a crucial approach for adapting large foundational models to specific tasks, particularly as model sizes continue to grow exponentially.

Through extensive experiments on various tasks, we validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical efficacy of our approach.

Conclusion: This work is a step toward developing theoretically grounded yet practically effective PEFT methods.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a crucial approach for
adapting large foundational models to specific tasks, particularly as model
sizes continue to grow exponentially. Among PEFT methods, Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) (arXiv:2106.09685) stands out for its effectiveness and simplicity,
expressing adaptations as a product of two low-rank matrices. While extensive
empirical studies demonstrate LoRA's practical utility, theoretical
understanding of such methods remains limited. Recent work on RAC-LoRA
(arXiv:2410.08305) took initial steps toward rigorous analysis. In this work,
we introduce Bernoulli-LoRA, a novel theoretical framework that unifies and

TL;DR: SNBO 是一种可扩展的、基于神经网络的黑盒优化方法，它不依赖于模型不确定性估计，在各种优化问题上优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高维空间和大量函数评估中，由于 GP 模型的计算复杂性，BO 面临可扩展性挑战。虽然神经网络 (NN) 提供了更好的可扩展性并且可以对复杂函数进行建模，但这导致了基于 NN 的 BO 方法的开发。然而，这些方法通常依赖于估计 NN 预测中的模型不确定性——这个过程通常计算密集且复杂，尤其是在高维度中。

Method: SNBO 采用单独的探索和利用标准添加新样本，同时自适应地控制采样区域以确保高效优化。

Result: SNBO 在 10 到 102 维的一系列优化问题上进行了评估，并与四种最先进的基线算法进行了比较。在大多数测试问题中，SNBO 获得了比性能最佳的基线算法更好的函数值，同时需要减少 40-60% 的函数评估次数，并将运行时间减少至少一个数量级。

Conclusion: SNBO在大多数测试问题上获得了比性能最佳的基线算法更好的函数值，同时需要减少 40-60% 的函数评估次数，并将运行时间减少至少一个数量级。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a widely used approach for blackbox
optimization that leverages a Gaussian process (GP) model and an acquisition
function to guide future sampling. While effective in low-dimensional settings,
BO faces scalability challenges in high-dimensional spaces and with large
number of function evaluations due to the computational complexity of GP
models. In contrast, neural networks (NNs) offer better scalability and can
model complex functions, which led to the development of NN-based BO
approaches. However, these methods typically rely on estimating model
uncertainty in NN prediction -- a process that is often computationally
intensive and complex, particularly in high dimensions. To address these
limitations, a novel method, called scalable neural network-based blackbox
optimization (SNBO), is proposed that does not rely on model uncertainty
estimation. Specifically, SNBO adds new samples using separate criteria for
exploration and exploitation, while adaptively controlling the sampling region
to ensure efficient optimization. SNBO is evaluated on a range of optimization
problems spanning from 10 to 102 dimensions and compared against four
state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Across the majority of test problems,
SNBO attains function values better than the best-performing baseline
algorithm, while requiring 40-60% fewer function evaluations and reducing the
runtime by at least an order of magnitude.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new bandit algorithm, DP-NCB, that is both privacy-preserving and fair, with strong theoretical guarantees and empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: It is critical to protect user data privacy and ensure fair treatment across decision rounds in bandit algorithms, but prior work has addressed privacy and fairness independently.

Method: The paper introduces a unified algorithmic framework called Differentially Private Nash Confidence Bound (DP-NCB).

Result: DP-NCB ensures ϵ-differential privacy and achieves order-optimal Nash regret, matching known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Simulations show DP-NCB incurs substantially lower Nash regret than state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Differentially Private Nash Confidence Bound (DP-NCB), a new algorithm that achieves both differential privacy and order-optimal Nash regret simultaneously.  Simulations show DP-NCB outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit algorithms are fundamental tools for sequential
decision-making under uncertainty, with widespread applications across domains
such as clinical trials and personalized decision-making. As bandit algorithms
are increasingly deployed in these socially sensitive settings, it becomes
critical to protect user data privacy and ensure fair treatment across decision
rounds. While prior work has independently addressed privacy and fairness in
bandit settings, the question of whether both objectives can be achieved
simultaneously has remained largely open. Existing privacy-preserving bandit
algorithms typically optimize average regret, a utilitarian measure, whereas
fairness-aware approaches focus on minimizing Nash regret, which penalizes
inequitable reward distributions, but often disregard privacy concerns.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce Differentially Private Nash Confidence Bound
(DP-NCB)-a novel and unified algorithmic framework that simultaneously ensures
$\epsilon$-differential privacy and achieves order-optimal Nash regret,
matching known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. The framework is
sufficiently general to operate under both global and local differential
privacy models, and is anytime, requiring no prior knowledge of the time
horizon. We support our theoretical guarantees with simulations on synthetic
bandit instances, showing that DP-NCB incurs substantially lower Nash regret
than state-of-the-art baselines. Our results offer a principled foundation for
designing bandit algorithms that are both privacy-preserving and fair, making
them suitable for high-stakes, socially impactful applications.

Result: VAE-DNN在效率和准确性方面均优于FNO和DeepONet模型。

Conclusion: VAE-DNN在非线性扩散方程的前向和反向解中，比FNO和DeepONet模型更有效率和准确。

Abstract: We propose a trainable-by-parts surrogate model for solving forward and
inverse parameterized nonlinear partial differential equations. Like several
other surrogate and operator learning models, the proposed approach employs an
encoder to reduce the high-dimensional input $y(\bm{x})$ to a lower-dimensional
latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$. Then, a fully connected neural network is
used to map $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$ to the latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_h}$, of
the PDE solution $h(\bm{x},t)$. Finally, a decoder is utilized to reconstruct
$h(\bm{x},t)$. The innovative aspect of our model is its ability to train its
three components independently. This approach leads to a substantial decrease
in both the time and energy required for training when compared to leading
operator learning models such as FNO and DeepONet. The separable training is
achieved by training the encoder as part of the variational autoencoder (VAE)
for $y(\bm{x})$ and the decoder as part of the $h(\bm{x},t)$ VAE. We refer to
this model as the VAE-DNN model. VAE-DNN is compared to the FNO and DeepONet
models for obtaining forward and inverse solutions to the nonlinear diffusion
equation governing groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer. Our findings
indicate that VAE-DNN not only demonstrates greater efficiency but also
delivers superior accuracy in both forward and inverse solutions compared to
the FNO and DeepONet models.

Abstract: Accurate spectrum demand prediction is crucial for informed spectrum
allocation, effective regulatory planning, and fostering sustainable growth in
modern wireless communication networks. It supports governmental efforts,
particularly those led by the international telecommunication union (ITU), to
establish fair spectrum allocation policies, improve auction mechanisms, and
meet the requirements of emerging technologies such as advanced 5G, forthcoming
6G, and the internet of things (IoT). This paper presents an effective
spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages crowdsourced user-side key
performance indicators (KPIs) and regulatory datasets to model and forecast
spectrum demand. The proposed methodology achieves superior prediction accuracy
and cross-regional generalizability by incorporating advanced feature
engineering, comprehensive correlation analysis, and transfer learning
techniques. Unlike traditional ITU models, which are often constrained by
arbitrary inputs and unrealistic assumptions, this approach exploits granular,
data-driven insights to account for spatial and temporal variations in spectrum
utilization. Comparative evaluations against ITU estimates, as the benchmark,
underscore our framework's capability to deliver more realistic and actionable

highlighting its potential as a robust approach for policymakers and regulatory
bodies to enhance spectrum management and planning.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of grape phenology is essential for timely vineyard
management decisions, such as scheduling irrigation and fertilization, to
maximize crop yield and quality. While traditional biophysical models
calibrated on historical field data can be used for season-long predictions,
they lack the precision required for fine-grained vineyard management. Deep
learning methods are a compelling alternative but their performance is hindered
by sparse phenology datasets, particularly at the cultivar level. We propose a
hybrid modeling approach that combines multi-task learning with a recurrent
neural network to parameterize a differentiable biophysical model. By using
multi-task learning to predict the parameters of the biophysical model, our
approach enables shared learning across cultivars while preserving biological
structure, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of predictions.
Empirical evaluation using real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrates that
our method significantly outperforms both conventional biophysical models and
baseline deep learning approaches in predicting phenological stages, as well as
other crop state variables such as cold-hardiness and wheat yield.

Abstract: Distance-based classifiers, such as k-nearest neighbors and support vector
machines, continue to be a workhorse of machine learning, widely used in
science and industry. In practice, to derive insights from these models, it is
also important to ensure that their predictions are explainable. While the
field of Explainable AI has supplied methods that are in principle applicable
to any model, it has also emphasized the usefulness of latent structures (e.g.
the sequence of layers in a neural network) to produce explanations. In this
paper, we contribute by uncovering a hidden neural network structure in
distance-based classifiers (consisting of linear detection units combined with
nonlinear pooling layers) upon which Explainable AI techniques such as
layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) become applicable. Through quantitative
evaluations, we demonstrate the advantage of our novel explanation approach
over several baselines. We also show the overall usefulness of explaining
distance-based models through two practical use cases.

Result: 聚类和主动学习之间存在相互作用，通常在不应用聚类时获得最佳性能。使用主动学习向训练集添加新样本确实可以提高模型性能，但总的来说，改进率低于文献中报告的结果。性能最初有所提高，但随着更多目标点被选择纳入训练，性能最终开始下降。

Conclusion: 主动学习是有效的，但模型性能的提升与选择和标记的点数之间呈线性平缓关系。

Abstract: This paper examines the effectiveness of combining active learning and
transfer learning for anomaly detection in cross-domain time-series data. Our
results indicate that there is an interaction between clustering and active
learning and in general the best performance is achieved using a single cluster
(in other words when clustering is not applied). Also, we find that adding new
samples to the training set using active learning does improve model
performance but that in general, the rate of improvement is slower than the
results reported in the literature suggest. We attribute this difference to an
improved experimental design where distinct data samples are used for the
sampling and testing pools. Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of
transfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets
and find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail
off as more target points are selected for inclusion in training. This tail-off
in performance may indicate that the active learning process is doing a good
job of sequencing data points for selection, pushing the less useful points
towards the end of the selection process and that this tail-off occurs when
these less useful points are eventually added. Taken together our results
indicate that active learning is effective but that the improvement in model
performance follows a linear flat function concerning the number of points
selected and labelled.

The approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the mass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space.

Abstract: Bridging the microscopic and the macroscopic modelling scales in crowd
dynamics constitutes an important, open challenge for systematic numerical
analysis, optimization, and control. We propose a combined manifold and machine
learning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent
crowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The
proposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation
Equation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and

mass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first
step, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete
microscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based
on manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space
into the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the
corresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning
reduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning
techniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the
crowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density
profiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density
distribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this "embed->learn in latent
space->lift back to the ambient space" pipeline, we create an effective
solution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution.
For our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a
corridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical
results demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus
allowing for fast and accurate modelling/simulation of crowd dynamics from
agent-based simulations.

*Simon Lepage,Jeremie Mary,David Picard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers can learn Markov chain transitions from context if they are big enough and trained enough, and better encoding helps with unseen structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating the capacity of transformers to learn algorithms involving their context.

Method: Trained transformers using next token prediction on Markov chains with random transition matrices.

Result: A threshold in transformer and training set size exists, above which the model learns to estimate transition probabilities. More involved encoding enables more robust prediction for different Markov chain structures.

Conclusion: Transformers can learn to estimate transition probabilities from context instead of memorizing training patterns when the model and training set are large enough.

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of transformers to learn algorithms involving
their context while solely being trained using next token prediction. We set up
Markov chains with random transition matrices and we train transformers to
predict the next token. Matrices used during training and test are different
and we show that there is a threshold in transformer size and in training set
size above which the model is able to learn to estimate the transition
probabilities from its context instead of memorizing the training patterns.
Additionally, we show that more involved encoding of the states enables more
robust prediction for Markov chains with structures different than those seen
during training.

*Pengxi Liu,Yi Shen,Matthew M. Engelhard,Benjamin A. Goldstein,Michael J. Pencina,Nicoleta J. Economou-Zavlanos,Michael M. Zavlanos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairPOT 是一种新颖的、与模型无关的后处理框架，它使用最佳传输策略性地对齐不同组的风险评分分布，但通过转换弱势群体中可控制的比例（即 top-lambda 分位数）有选择地进行对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗保健、金融和刑事司法等高风险领域，利用接收器操作特征曲线下面积 (AUC) 的公平性指标越来越受到关注。在这些领域中，公平性通常通过风险评分而不是二元结果来评估，一个常见的挑战是，强制执行严格的公平性会显着降低 AUC 性能。

Method: Fair Proportional Optimal Transport (FairPOT)

Result: 通过改变 lambda，我们的方法允许在减少 AUC 差异和保持整体 AUC 性能之间进行可调的权衡。此外，我们将 FairPOT 扩展到部分 AUC 设置，从而使公平性干预能够集中在高风险区域。在合成、公共和临床数据集上进行的大量实验表明

Conclusion: FairPOT在全局和局部AUC场景中始终优于现有的后处理技术，通常以轻微的AUC降级或甚至效用的积极增益来实现改进的公平性。FairPOT的计算效率和实际适应性使其成为现实部署的有前途的解决方案。

Abstract: Fairness metrics utilizing the area under the receiver operator
characteristic curve (AUC) have gained increasing attention in high-stakes
domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. In these domains,
fairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a
common challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade
AUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional
Optimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework
that strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups
using optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable
proportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged
group. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between
reducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance. Furthermore,
we extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions
to concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic,
public, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms
existing post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios,
often achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive
gains in utility. The computational efficiency and practical adaptability of
FairPOT make it a promising solution for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: BubbleONet is a promising surrogate model for simulating bubble dynamics, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional numerical solvers.

Abstract: This paper introduces BubbleONet, an operator learning model designed to map

### [177] [Dynamic User-controllable Privacy-preserving Few-shot Sensing Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03989)
*Ajesh Koyatan Chathoth,Shuhao Yu,Stephen Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PrivCLIP是一种动态的、用户可控的、少样本的隐私保护传感框架，它允许用户指定和修改他们的隐私偏好，并在识别到隐私敏感活动时，将原始数据转换为隐私合规的版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户可控的隐私在现代传感系统中非常重要，因为隐私偏好因人而异，并且可能会随着时间的推移而演变。这在配备惯性测量单元 (IMU) 传感器的设备（如智能手机和可穿戴设备）中尤其重要，这些设备会不断收集丰富的时间序列数据，这些数据可能会无意中暴露敏感的用户行为。虽然之前的工作已经提出了传感器数据的隐私保护方法，但大多数方法依赖于静态的、预定义的隐私标签或需要大量的私有训练数据，从而限制了它们的适应性和用户自主性。

Method: PrivCLIP利用多模态对比学习方法，在共享嵌入空间中对齐IMU传感器数据和自然语言活动描述，从而实现对敏感活动的少量检测。当识别出隐私敏感活动时，系统使用语言引导的活动清理器和运动生成模块 (IMU-GPT) 将原始数据转换为在语义上类似于非敏感活动的隐私合规版本。

Result: PrivCLIP 允许用户通过将活动分类为敏感（黑名单）、非敏感（白名单）或中性（灰名单）来指定和修改他们的隐私偏好。

Conclusion: PrivCLIP在多个人类活动识别数据集上进行了评估，并在隐私保护和数据效用方面显着优于基线方法。

Abstract: User-controllable privacy is important in modern sensing systems, as privacy
preferences can vary significantly from person to person and may evolve over
time. This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously
collect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user
behaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor
data, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large
quantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user
agency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable,
few-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework. PrivCLIP allows users to specify
and modify their privacy preferences by categorizing activities as sensitive
(black-listed), non-sensitive (white-listed), or neutral (gray-listed).
Leveraging a multimodal contrastive learning approach, PrivCLIP aligns IMU
sensor data with natural language activity descriptions in a shared embedding
space, enabling few-shot detection of sensitive activities. When a
privacy-sensitive activity is identified, the system uses a language-guided
activity sanitizer and a motion generation module (IMU-GPT) to transform the
original data into a privacy-compliant version that semantically resembles a
non-sensitive activity. We evaluate PrivCLIP on multiple human activity
recognition datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms baseline
methods in terms of both privacy protection and data utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TC-LoRA通过在文本和参数级别解决任务干扰问题，提高了LLM在多任务环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多任务设置中，合并在异构源上训练的LoRA适配器经常导致任务干扰，从而降低下游性能。

Method: 提出了一种张量化聚类LoRA (TC-LoRA) 库，旨在解决文本级别和参数级别的任务干扰问题。在文本级别，我们在嵌入空间中对训练样本进行聚类，以捕获输入格式的相似性，然后为每个集群训练一个专门的LoRA适配器。在参数级别，我们引入了一种联合典型Polyadic (CP)分解，该分解解开了跨LoRA适配器的特定于任务和共享的因素。

Result: 与强大的基于SVD的基线相比，TC-LoRA在Phi-3上实现了+1.4%的准确率，在Mistral-7B上实现了+2.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: TC-LoRA在LLM适应性方面表现出有效性，在Phi-3上实现了+1.4%的准确率，在Mistral-7B上实现了+2.3%的准确率。

Abstract: Despite the success of the monolithic dense paradigm of large language models
(LLMs), the LoRA adapters offer an efficient solution by fine-tuning small
task-specific modules and merging them with the base model. However, in
multi-task settings, merging LoRA adapters trained on heterogeneous sources
frequently causes \textit{task interference}, degrading downstream performance.
To address this, we propose a tensorized clustered LoRA (TC-LoRA) library
targeting to address the task interference at the \textit{text-level} and
\textit{parameter-level}. At the \textit{text-level}, we cluster the training
samples in the embedding space to capture input-format similarities, then train
a specialized LoRA adapter for each cluster. At the \textit{parameter-level},
we introduce a joint Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition that disentangles
task-specific and shared factors across LoRA adapters. This joint factorization
preserves essential knowledge while reducing cross-task interference. Extensive
experiments on out-of-domain zero-shot and skill-composition tasks-including
reasoning, question answering, and coding. Compared to strong SVD-based
baselines, TC-LoRA achieves +1.4\% accuracy on Phi-3 and +2.3\% on Mistral-7B
(+2.3\%), demonstrating the effectiveness of TC-LoRA in LLM adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DCFL是一种新的联邦学习框架，通过解耦对比损失来解决数据异质性问题，并在标准基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习是一种分布式机器学习范例，允许多个参与者通过交换模型更新而不是原始数据来训练共享模型。然而，由于客户端之间的数据异质性，与集中式方法相比，其性能有所下降。虽然对比学习已成为一种很有前途的缓解方法，但我们的理论分析揭示了一个根本冲突：其无限数量负样本的渐近假设在联邦学习的有限样本机制中被违反。

Method: 解耦对比学习用于联邦学习 (DCFL)，这是一种新颖的框架，可将现有的对比损失解耦为两个目标。

Result: DCFL 在正样本之间实现了更强的对齐，并且与现有的对比学习方法相比，在负样本之间实现了更大的一致性。

Conclusion: DCFL在标准基准测试（包括 CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100 和 Tiny-ImageNet）上的实验结果表明，DCFL 始终优于最先进的联邦学习方法。

Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm that allows
multiple participants to train a shared model by exchanging model updates
instead of their raw data. However, its performance is degraded compared to
centralized approaches due to data heterogeneity across clients. While
contrastive learning has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this, our
theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental conflict: its asymptotic assumptions
of an infinite number of negative samples are violated in finite-sample regime
of federated learning. To address this issue, we introduce Decoupled
Contrastive Learning for Federated Learning (DCFL), a novel framework that
decouples the existing contrastive loss into two objectives. Decoupling the
loss into its alignment and uniformity components enables the independent
calibration of the attraction and repulsion forces without relying on the
asymptotic assumptions. This strategy provides a contrastive learning method
suitable for federated learning environments where each client has a small
amount of data. Our experimental results show that DCFL achieves stronger
alignment between positive samples and greater uniformity between negative
samples compared to existing contrastive learning methods. Furthermore,
experimental results on standard benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet, demonstrate that DCFL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
federated learning methods.

Motivation: focusing on their usability, performance, and deployment trade-offs

Method: comparative survey of TensorFlow and PyTorch

Result: PyTorch offers simplicity and flexibility favored in research, whereas TensorFlow provides a fuller production-ready ecosystem

Conclusion: while both frameworks are highly capable for state-of-the-art deep learning, they exhibit distinct trade-offs: PyTorch offers simplicity and flexibility favored in research, whereas TensorFlow provides a fuller production-ready ecosystem - understanding these trade-offs is key for practitioners selecting the appropriate tool

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative survey of TensorFlow and
PyTorch, the two leading deep learning frameworks, focusing on their usability,
performance, and deployment trade-offs. We review each framework's programming
paradigm and developer experience, contrasting TensorFlow's graph-based (now
optionally eager) approach with PyTorch's dynamic, Pythonic style. We then
compare model training speeds and inference performance across multiple tasks
and data regimes, drawing on recent benchmarks and studies. Deployment
flexibility is examined in depth - from TensorFlow's mature ecosystem
(TensorFlow Lite for mobile/embedded, TensorFlow Serving, and JavaScript
support) to PyTorch's newer production tools (TorchScript compilation, ONNX
export, and TorchServe). We also survey ecosystem and community support,
including library integrations, industry adoption, and research trends (e.g.,
PyTorch's dominance in recent research publications versus TensorFlow's broader
tooling in enterprise). Applications in computer vision, natural language
processing, and other domains are discussed to illustrate how each framework is
used in practice. Finally, we outline future directions and open challenges in
deep learning framework design, such as unifying eager and graph execution,
improving cross-framework interoperability, and integrating compiler
optimizations (XLA, JIT) for improved speed. Our findings indicate that while
both frameworks are highly capable for state-of-the-art deep learning, they
exhibit distinct trade-offs: PyTorch offers simplicity and flexibility favored
in research, whereas TensorFlow provides a fuller production-ready ecosystem -
understanding these trade-offs is key for practitioners selecting the
appropriate tool. We include charts, code snippets, and more than 20 references
to academic papers and official documentation to support this comparative
analysis

Motivation: 数据集方面的异质性引入了显着的领域偏差，从根本上降低了时间序列基础模型 (TSFM) 的泛化能力，但这一挑战仍未得到充分探索。本文重新思考了使用联邦学习范式开发 TSFM。

Method: 我们提出了一种新颖的联邦数据集学习 (FeDaL) 方法，通过学习与数据集无关的时间表示来解决异构时间序列。

Result: FeDaL 通过添加两个互补机制：领域偏差消除 (DBE) 和全局偏差消除 (GBE)，明确地缓解了局部和全局偏差。

Conclusion: FeDaL在跨数据集泛化方面进行了广泛的评估，在包含表征学习和下游时间序列分析的八项任务的真实世界数据集中，针对 54 个基线进行了评估。我们进一步分析了联邦缩放行为，展示了数据量、客户端数量和加入率如何影响去中心化下的模型性能。

Abstract: Dataset-wise heterogeneity introduces significant domain biases that
fundamentally degrade generalization on Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs),
yet this challenge remains underexplored. This paper rethink the development of
TSFMs using the paradigm of federated learning. We propose a novel Federated
Dataset Learning (FeDaL) approach to tackle heterogeneous time series by
learning dataset-agnostic temporal representations. Specifically, the
distributed architecture of federated learning is a nature solution to
decompose heterogeneous TS datasets into shared generalized knowledge and
preserved personalized knowledge. Moreover, based on the TSFM architecture,
FeDaL explicitly mitigates both local and global biases by adding two
complementary mechanisms: Domain Bias Elimination (DBE) and Global Bias
Elimination (GBE). FeDaL`s cross-dataset generalization has been extensively
evaluated in real-world datasets spanning eight tasks, including both
representation learning and downstream time series analysis, against 54
baselines. We further analyze federated scaling behavior, showing how data
volume, client count, and join rate affect model performance under
decentralization.

Conclusion: QTFT在预测数据集上成功训练，能够准确预测未来值。在某些测试用例中，该模型在训练和测试损失方面优于其经典对应模型，而在其余情况下，它实现了相当的性能。该方法的一个关键优势在于它基于变分量子算法，可以在当前的噪声中等规模量子 (NISQ) 设备上实施，而对量子比特或电路深度的数量没有严格的要求。

Abstract: The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), proposed by Lim et al.
[\textit{International Journal of Forecasting}, 2021], is a state-of-the-art
attention-based deep neural network architecture specifically designed for
multi-horizon time series forecasting. It has demonstrated significant
performance improvements over existing benchmarks. In this work, we propose a
Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer (QTFT), a quantum-enhanced hybrid
quantum-classical architecture that extends the capabilities of the classical
TFT framework. Our results demonstrate that QTFT is successfully trained on the
forecasting datasets and is capable of accurately predicting future values. In
particular, our experimental results display that in certain test cases, the
model outperforms its classical counterpart in terms of both training and test
loss, while in the remaining cases, it achieves comparable performance. A key
advantage of our approach lies in its foundation on a variational quantum
algorithm, enabling implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用少量数据对大型语言模型进行微调，以改进自动简答题评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近，改进自动简答题评分的研究主要集中在使用提示工程的大型语言模型 (LLM) 以及无或少量样本提示上，以实现最佳结果。这与微调方法形成对比，后者历来需要大多数用户无法访问的大规模计算集群。

Method: 使用量化低秩自适应 (QLORA) 等开放权重的方法可用于在消费级 GPU 上微调模型。我们评估了这两种微调方法，测量了它们与少量样本提示的交互作用，以实现具有结构化 (JSON) 输出的自动简答题评分 (ASAG)。

Result: 使用少量数据进行微调对于 Llama 开放权重模型的效用有限，但对于 OpenAI 的闭源模型，微调方法可以胜过少量样本基线指令调整的 LLM。我们发现一些证据表明，观察到的微调好处可能受到领域主题的影响。通过用大量廉价生成的合成训练数据为初始训练示例设定种子，LLama 3.1 8B-Instruct 开放权重模型得到了显着改进。

Conclusion: 小规模数据微调对 Llama 开放权重模型的效用有限，但对于 OpenAI 的闭源模型，微调方法可以胜过少量样本基线指令调整的 LLM。 finetuning 的好处可能受到领域主题的影响。 通过用大量廉价生成的合成训练数据为初始训练示例设定种子，LLama 3.1 8B-Instruct 开放权重模型得到了显着改进。

Abstract: Research to improve Automated Short Answer Grading has recently focused on
Large Language Models (LLMs) with prompt engineering and no- or few-shot
prompting to achieve best results. This is in contrast to the fine-tuning
approach, which has historically required large-scale compute clusters
inaccessible to most users. New closed-model approaches such as OpenAI's
fine-tuning service promise results with as few as 100 examples, while methods
using open weights such as quantized low-rank adaptive (QLORA) can be used to
fine-tune models on consumer GPUs. We evaluate both of these fine-tuning
methods, measuring their interaction with few-shot prompting for automated
short answer grading (ASAG) with structured (JSON) outputs. Our results show
that finetuning with small amounts of data has limited utility for Llama
open-weight models, but that fine-tuning methods can outperform few-shot
baseline instruction-tuned LLMs for OpenAI's closed models. While our
evaluation set is limited, we find some evidence that the observed benefits of
finetuning may be impacted by the domain subject matter. Lastly, we observed
dramatic improvement with the LLama 3.1 8B-Instruct open-weight model by
seeding the initial training examples with a significant amount of cheaply
generated synthetic training data.

Motivation: existing methods are limited by fixed-pattern or single-target triggers, making them inflexible and easier to detect

Conclusion: FLAT achieves high attack success and remains robust against advanced FL defenses, highlighting the urgent need for new defense strategies to address latent-driven, multi-target backdoor threats in federated settings.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, yet most existing
methods are limited by fixed-pattern or single-target triggers, making them
inflexible and easier to detect. We propose FLAT (FL Arbitrary-Target Attack),
a novel backdoor attack that leverages a latent-driven conditional autoencoder
to generate diverse, target-specific triggers as needed. By introducing a
latent code, FLAT enables the creation of visually adaptive and highly variable
triggers, allowing attackers to select arbitrary targets without retraining and
to evade conventional detection mechanisms. Our approach unifies attack
success, stealth, and diversity within a single framework, introducing a new
level of flexibility and sophistication to backdoor attacks in FL. Extensive
experiments show that FLAT achieves high attack success and remains robust
against advanced FL defenses. These results highlight the urgent need for new
defense strategies to address latent-driven, multi-target backdoor threats in
federated settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种对抗性公平多视图聚类 (AFMVC) 框架，该框架通过对抗训练消除敏感属性信息，并通过 KL 散度对齐聚类分配，从而在公平性和聚类性能方面都取得了优异的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，多视图聚类由于其整合来自多个视图的互补信息的能力而受到越来越多的关注。然而，现有方法主要侧重于聚类性能，而公平性（以人为本的应用中的一个关键问题）在很大程度上被忽视了。尽管最近的研究已经探索了多视图聚类中的群体公平性，但大多数方法对聚类分配施加了显式正则化，依赖于敏感属性和底层聚类结构之间的对齐。然而，这种假设在实践中经常失败，并且会降低聚类性能。

Method: 提出了一种对抗性公平多视图聚类 (AFMVC) 框架，该框架将公平性学习集成到表示学习过程中。具体来说，我们的方法采用对抗性训练从根本上消除学习到的特征中的敏感属性信息，确保生成的聚类分配不受其影响。此外，我们从理论上证明，通过 KL 散度将特定于视图的聚类分配与公平不变的共识分布对齐可以保持聚类一致性，而不会显着损害公平性，从而为我们的框架提供额外的理论保证。

Result: AFMVC实现了优于现有方法的卓越公平性和有竞争力的聚类性能。

Conclusion: AFMVC在具有公平性约束的数据集上实现了优于现有多视图聚类和公平感知聚类方法的卓越公平性和有竞争力的聚类性能。

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental problem in data mining and machine
learning. In recent years, multi-view clustering has attracted increasing
attention due to its ability to integrate complementary information from
multiple views. However, existing methods primarily focus on clustering
performance, while fairness-a critical concern in human-centered
applications-has been largely overlooked. Although recent studies have explored
group fairness in multi-view clustering, most methods impose explicit
regularization on cluster assignments, relying on the alignment between
sensitive attributes and the underlying cluster structure. However, this
assumption often fails in practice and can degrade clustering performance. In
this paper, we propose an adversarial fair multi-view clustering (AFMVC)
framework that integrates fairness learning into the representation learning
process. Specifically, our method employs adversarial training to fundamentally
remove sensitive attribute information from learned features, ensuring that the
resulting cluster assignments are unaffected by it. Furthermore, we
theoretically prove that aligning view-specific clustering assignments with a
fairness-invariant consensus distribution via KL divergence preserves
clustering consistency without significantly compromising fairness, thereby
providing additional theoretical guarantees for our framework. Extensive
experiments on data sets with fairness constraints demonstrate that AFMVC
achieves superior fairness and competitive clustering performance compared to
existing multi-view clustering and fairness-aware clustering methods.

Conclusion: VLMs容易泄露训练数据，对VLMs进行模型反演攻击会造成严重的隐私威胁。

Abstract: Model inversion (MI) attacks pose significant privacy risks by reconstructing
private training data from trained neural networks. While prior works have
focused on conventional unimodal DNNs, the vulnerability of vision-language
models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct the first study
to understand VLMs' vulnerability in leaking private visual training data. To
tailored for VLMs' token-based generative nature, we propose a suite of novel
token-based and sequence-based model inversion strategies. Particularly, we
propose Token-based Model Inversion (TMI), Convergent Token-based Model
Inversion (TMI-C), Sequence-based Model Inversion (SMI), and Sequence-based
Model Inversion with Adaptive Token Weighting (SMI-AW). Through extensive
experiments and user study on three state-of-the-art VLMs and multiple
datasets, we demonstrate, for the first time, that VLMs are susceptible to
training data leakage. The experiments show that our proposed sequence-based
methods, particularly SMI-AW combined with a logit-maximization loss based on
vocabulary representation, can achieve competitive reconstruction and
outperform token-based methods in attack accuracy and visual similarity.
Importantly, human evaluation of the reconstructed images yields an attack
accuracy of 75.31\%, underscoring the severity of model inversion threats in
VLMs. Notably we also demonstrate inversion attacks on the publicly released
VLMs. Our study reveals the privacy vulnerability of VLMs as they become
increasingly popular across many applications such as healthcare and finance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a consistency-aware policy optimization framework to address vanishing gradients in rule-based reward systems, improving training efficiency and performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of vanishing gradients in rule-based reward systems when multiple sampled responses converge to identical outcomes, limiting training efficiency.

Method: The paper proposes a consistency-aware policy optimization framework with a structured global reward based on outcome consistency and an entropy-based soft blending mechanism.

Result: The proposed framework achieves substantial performance gains on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a consistency-aware policy optimization framework that uses a structured global reward based on outcome consistency and an entropy-based soft blending mechanism to improve training efficiency and performance, validated by performance gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving tasks. Recently, the
introduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging
rule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions
and guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across
many replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses
under a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or
incorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to
vanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for
learning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.
To address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization
framework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome
consistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs
show high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives
meaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and
self-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we
incorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances
local advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic
transitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method
introduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization
strategy. We validate its effectiveness through substantial performance gains
on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, highlighting the proposed
framework's robustness and general applicability. Code of this work has been

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geographical and weather features vary from location to location which introduces domain shift - a major bottleneck to develop location-agnostic prediction model.  the lack of properly labeled data and storage issues make the task even more challenging.

Method: a semi-supervised deep domain adaptation framework, allowing accurate predictions with minimal labeled data from the target location. It involves training a deep convolutional neural network on a source location's data and adapting it to the target location using a source-free, teacher-student model configuration. The teacher-student model leverages consistency and cross-entropy loss for semi-supervised learning, ensuring effective adaptation without any source data requirement for prediction.

Abstract: Accurate solar generation prediction is essential for proper estimation of
renewable energy resources across diverse geographic locations. However,
geographical and weather features vary from location to location which
introduces domain shift - a major bottleneck to develop location-agnostic
prediction model. As a result, a machine-learning model which can perform well
to predict solar power in one location, may exhibit subpar performance in
another location. Moreover, the lack of properly labeled data and storage
issues make the task even more challenging. In order to address domain shift
due to varying weather conditions across different meteorological regions, this
paper presents a semi-supervised deep domain adaptation framework, allowing
accurate predictions with minimal labeled data from the target location. Our
approach involves training a deep convolutional neural network on a source
location's data and adapting it to the target location using a source-free,
teacher-student model configuration. The teacher-student model leverages
consistency and cross-entropy loss for semi-supervised learning, ensuring
effective adaptation without any source data requirement for prediction. With
annotation of only $20 \%$ data in the target domain, our approach exhibits an
improvement upto $11.36 \%$, $6.65 \%$, $4.92\%$ for California, Florida and

*Neng Kai Nigel Neo,Lim Jing,Ngoui Yong Zhau Preston,Koh Xue Ting Serene,Bingquan Shen*

TL;DR: A new pipeline using MIST and MolForge significantly improves molecular structure generation from mass spectra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve de novo molecular generation from mass spectra.

Method: Using MIST as the encoder and MolForge as the decoder, with thresholding probabilities as a step function.

Result: The pipeline generates top-1 28% / top-10 36% of molecular structures correctly from mass spectra.

Conclusion: This method improves molecular structure generation from mass spectra, achieving a tenfold improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: A common approach to the \emph{de novo} molecular generation problem from
mass spectra involves a two-stage pipeline: (1) encoding mass spectra into
molecular fingerprints, followed by (2) decoding these fingerprints into
molecular structures. In our work, we adopt
\textsc{MIST}~\citep{MISTgoldmanAnnotatingMetaboliteMass2023} as the encoder
and \textsc{MolForge}~\citep{ucakReconstructionLosslessMolecular2023} as the
decoder, leveraging pretraining to enhance performance. Notably, pretraining
\textsc{MolForge} proves especially effective, enabling it to serve as a robust
fingerprint-to-structure decoder. Additionally, instead of passing the
probability of each bit in the fingerprint, thresholding the probabilities as a
step function helps focus the decoder on the presence of substructures,
improving recovery of accurate molecular structures even when the fingerprints
predicted by \textsc{MIST} only moderately resembles the ground truth in terms
of Tanimoto similarity. This combination of encoder and decoder results in a
tenfold improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, generating top-1
28\% / top-10 36\% of molecular structures correctly from mass spectra. We
position this pipeline as a strong baseline for future research in \emph{de
novo} molecule elucidation from mass spectra.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的神经网络训练方法SAMT，通过交替更新网络参数和自适应步长策略，提高了训练稳定性和泛化性能，并减少了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络的训练本质上是一个非凸优化问题，然而诸如随机梯度下降(SGD)等标准方法需要同时更新所有参数，这通常导致不稳定的收敛和高计算成本。为了解决这些问题

Method: 提出了一种新的方法，即可训练步长的随机交替最小化(SAMT)，该方法通过将每一层的权重视为一个块，以交替的方式更新网络参数。受元学习的启发，我们提出了一种新的自适应步长策略，将其纳入交替更新的子问题求解步骤中。

Result: SAMT实现了更好的泛化性能，并且参数更新次数更少。

Conclusion: SAMT在多个基准测试中表现出更好的泛化性能，并且参数更新次数更少，展示了其在神经网络优化中的有效性和潜力。

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks is inherently a nonconvex optimization
problem, yet standard approaches such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
require simultaneous updates to all parameters, often leading to unstable
convergence and high computational cost. To address these issues, we propose a
novel method, Stochastic Alternating Minimization with Trainable Step Sizes
(SAMT), which updates network parameters in an alternating manner by treating
the weights of each layer as a block. By decomposing the overall optimization
into sub-problems corresponding to different blocks, this block-wise
alternating strategy reduces per-step computational overhead and enhances
training stability in nonconvex settings. To fully leverage these benefits,
inspired by meta-learning, we proposed a novel adaptive step size strategy to
incorporate into the sub-problem solving steps of alternating updates. It
supports different types of trainable step sizes, including but not limited to
scalar, element-wise, row-wise, and column-wise, enabling adaptive step size
selection tailored to each block via meta-learning. We further provide a
theoretical convergence guarantee for the proposed algorithm, establishing its
optimization soundness. Extensive experiments for multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that SAMT achieves better generalization performance with fewer
parameter updates compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its
effectiveness and potential in neural network optimization.

TL;DR: CRA通过估计推理路径的真实奖励来缓解奖励攻击，并在数学解决数据集上提高了准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 外部推理系统容易受到奖励攻击，其中高分但逻辑上不正确的路径被PRM分配高分，导致不正确的答案。从因果推理的角度来看，我们将这种现象主要归因于混淆语义特征的存在。

Method: Causal Reward Adjustment (CRA)

Result: 在数学解决数据集上的实验表明，CRA缓解了奖励攻击并提高了最终准确率。

Conclusion: CRA缓解了奖励攻击并提高了最终准确率，无需修改策略模型或重新训练PRM。

Abstract: External reasoning systems combine language models with process reward models
(PRMs) to select high-quality reasoning paths for complex tasks such as
mathematical problem solving. However, these systems are prone to reward
hacking, where high-scoring but logically incorrect paths are assigned high
scores by the PRMs, leading to incorrect answers. From a causal inference
perspective, we attribute this phenomenon primarily to the presence of
confounding semantic features. To address it, we propose Causal Reward
Adjustment (CRA), a method that mitigates reward hacking by estimating the true
reward of a reasoning path. CRA trains sparse autoencoders on the PRM's
internal activations to recover interpretable features, then corrects
confounding by using backdoor adjustment. Experiments on math solving datasets
demonstrate that CRA mitigates reward hacking and improves final accuracy,
without modifying the policy model or retraining PRM.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper introduces symmetric divergences to behavior regularization policy optimization (BRPO) to establish a novel offline RL framework. Existing methods focus on asymmetric divergences such as KL to obtain analytic regularized policies and a practical minimization objective. We show that symmetric divergences do not permit an analytic policy as regularization and can incur numerical issues as loss. We tackle these challenges by the Taylor series of $f$-divergence.

Method: Taylor series of f-divergence

Result: an analytic policy can be obtained with a finite series; symmetric divergences can be decomposed into an asymmetry and a conditional symmetry term, Taylor-expanding the latter alleviates numerical issues

Conclusion: Symmetric f Actor-Critic (S$f$-AC) performs competitively on distribution approximation and MuJoCo.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) powered agents have emerged as effective planners
for Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems. While most existing AutoML
approaches focus on automating feature engineering and model architecture
search, recent studies in time series forecasting suggest that lightweight
models can often achieve state-of-the-art performance. This observation led us
to explore improving data quality, rather than model architecture, as a
potentially fruitful direction for AutoML on time series data. We propose
DCATS, a Data-Centric Agent for Time Series. DCATS leverages metadata
accompanying time series to clean data while optimizing forecasting
performance. We evaluated DCATS using four time series forecasting models on a
large-scale traffic volume forecasting dataset. Results demonstrate that DCATS
achieves an average 6% error reduction across all tested models and time
horizons, highlighting the potential of data-centric approaches in AutoML for

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep learning method for automated Doppler angle estimation in ultrasound images, achieving promising results with the best model outperforming the acceptable clinical error threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incorrect angle estimation is a leading cause of error in Doppler-based blood velocity measurements.

Method: A deep learning-based approach was developed using 2100 human carotid ultrasound images with augmentation. Five pre-trained models extracted image features, which were then used in a custom shallow network for Doppler angle estimation. Manual measurements were also obtained for comparison.

Result: The mean absolute error (MAE) between the automated and manual angle estimates ranged from 3.9 to 9.4 degrees for the models evaluated. The best performing model's MAE was less than the acceptable clinical Doppler angle error threshold.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates the potential of using a deep-learning based technique for automated ultrasound Doppler angle estimation, which could be implemented in commercial ultrasound scanners.

Abstract: Angle estimation is an important step in the Doppler ultrasound clinical
workflow to measure blood velocity. It is widely recognized that incorrect
angle estimation is a leading cause of error in Doppler-based blood velocity
measurements. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for
automated Doppler angle estimation. The approach was developed using 2100 human
carotid ultrasound images including image augmentation. Five pre-trained models
were used to extract images features, and these features were passed to a
custom shallow network for Doppler angle estimation. Independently,
measurements were obtained by a human observer reviewing the images for
comparison. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the automated and manual
angle estimates ranged from 3.9{\deg} to 9.4{\deg} for the models evaluated.
Furthermore, the MAE for the best performing model was less than the acceptable
clinical Doppler angle error threshold thus avoiding misclassification of
normal velocity values as a stenosis. The results demonstrate potential for
applying a deep-learning based technique for automated ultrasound Doppler angle
estimation. Such a technique could potentially be implemented within the
imaging software on commercial ultrasound scanners.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) seeks to model temporal dynamics
among variables to predict future trends. Transformer-based models and large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their ability to capture
long-range dependencies and patterns. However, current methods often rely on
rigid inductive biases, ignore intervariable interactions, or apply static
fusion strategies that limit adaptability across forecast horizons. These
limitations create bottlenecks in capturing nuanced, horizon-specific
relationships in time-series data. To solve this problem, we propose T3Time, a
novel trimodal framework consisting of time, spectral, and prompt branches,
where the dedicated frequency encoding branch captures the periodic structures
along with a gating mechanism that learns prioritization between temporal and
spectral features based on the prediction horizon. We also proposed a mechanism
which adaptively aggregates multiple cross-modal alignment heads by dynamically
weighting the importance of each head based on the features. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average reduction of 3.28%
in MSE and 2.29% in MAE. Furthermore, it shows strong generalization in
few-shot learning settings: with 5% training data, we see a reduction in MSE
and MAE by 4.13% and 1.91%, respectively; and with 10% data, by 3.62% and 1.98%
on average. Code - https://github.com/monaf-chowdhury/T3Time/
